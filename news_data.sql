It’s a country that’s casual about a few things, from plane timetables to customs regulations to automatic weapons.\n\nHe sniffs the air in the same casual manner with which he hangs the rifle on his shoulder. “Will it rain?” he replies. “It depends on the weather.”\n\n“DO you think it will rain tonight?” I ask Joseph, the man with the gun. He looks up, beyond the mist clinging to the valley, doing its damnedest to conceal the river-ridden jungle that is to be our home for the next few days.\n\nIt’s never been an easy place to visit. Two weeks by the pool, this is not. But head away from the capital, Port Moresby, to travel deep into the jungles and you’ll find PNG one of the most fascinating places on the planet.\n\nThe problem is the best spots are also the most inaccessible; roads are not exactly forthcoming, hotels are poor, travelling is tricky. With a little thought, though, the solution is obvious. Employ the method that the local tribes have known about for centuries and get on a boat.\n\nSepik Spirit is a small, comfortable vessel that chugs up and down the Karawari River, a tributary of the Sepik in the country’s north, allowing you a way into villages and landscapes that can’t be reached by other means.\n\nStep ashore and witness a culture and a daily life that is utterly different from anything you know.\n\nBack on board, you’ll eat well, thanks to the ship’s excellent chefs; there’s beer and wine (though, ironically given the name, no spirits); and the nine two-berth cabins all have picture windows, so you can watch this extraordinary land pass by from the comfort of your bed. And it is extraordinary.\n\nThere are more than 800 languages in PNG. It’s rich in plant and birdlife; orchids and birds of paradise are abundant. Germany, Britain and Australia have all laid claim to parts of the coast over the years, but the lush interior was only reached by outsiders in the 1930s.\n\nWhat these pioneers found were a million people who believed the explorers to be ghosts. They feared the dead had turned white and come back to haunt them.\n\nThey had no knowledge of a modern world beyond the trees, and even now they’re still there, hunting with bows and arrows and stone axes, fearing the demons that come out of the jungle at night, and being entirely suspicious of the outsider who arrives in the day.\n\n“The chief welcomes you,” says Alfonso, my translator and guide, as I am offered sago bread, which tastes like a grey flat nothing of mulched tree pulp, because that’s what it is.\n\nI don’t wish to offend. Even so, I turn down the offer of a drink. Drinks in these remote villages can take the form of an initiation ceremony in which a teenage boy’s genitals are cut with bamboo while he imbibes a beverage made from betel nut mixed with ginger and blood from his father.\n\nThat’s a cocktail you certainly won’t find at a resort pool bar.\n\nNext morning, I wake as the sunshine burns the mist off the valley, as if to uncover more of its secrets. “Come,” Alfonso says, “it is time to meet the mud men.”\n\nAway from the boat, in the highlands province of Chimbu, I find myself sitting in a clearing, while men with dirt-painted torsos, their faces obscured by demon masks made of clay, perform a ritualistic dance telling of the old ways, when creatures would come from the mountains at night to take their children.\n\nThey still passionately believe in these monsters and I begin to as well when they top off their impressive blur of semi-naked rhythmic, sinewy movement and sacred chanting with the mock sacrifice of a child.\n\nAfterwards, as I thank my hosts and make to leave, the village witch doctor beckons me over, muttering his spells as he bids me stare into his bag of bones. Alfonso says, as if sensing my disquiet, “It is his pig-bone bag. For herbs. For his magic. He says not to believe everything you read.”\n\nToday, this sounds crazy. Dead-pig magic belongs to a different time. Yet somehow, if you immerse yourself in PNG, it all makes sense.\n\nAs recently as 2013, Britain had a Sorcery Act, which allowed an accusation of black magic to be used as a defence for murder. Though time has moved on and you’ll be safe with the guides and the guards, old beliefs and customs hold sway.\n\nOut here, disputes are still solved by the beating of bamboo on ancestral spirit drums, whose ghosts decide whether two tribes will go to war. And they eat crocodiles.\n\nIn this regard, the tribespeople are keen to show me the ropes. And not only the ropes, but the spears, the paddles and the dugout canoes. We cast off late at night on the Sepik, the water reflecting the Milky Way (light pollution is not an issue).\n\nOur mission: to hunt crocodiles, which are killed for their meat and valuable skins. That said, the sound a skull-speared crocodile makes when being dragged on to a boat is something you don’t forget. But the village will eat. That is survival.\n\nYet the crocodile is also revered, particularly among the Kaningara tribe of the Blackwater River. Here, in the murky tributaries of the Sepik, for boys to become men, they are led into spirit houses and, over the course of weeks, the markings of the sacred crocodile are cut ritualistically into their skin.\n\nThe scars last forever, making generations of men with crocodile flesh. In a land filled with the spiritual art of masks, totems and carvings, it’s the ultimate exhibit.\n\nIf your idea of a holiday is adventure, if you want to step back in time into a world where painted men gather in huts to make peace with the spirits and women fish on the river banks, their babies clamped to their bosoms, get in early before the tourism dollar turns it all into a theme park.\n\nThe river, oblivious, passes by just as time has passed these people by, overlooked by a modern world that has neglected to realise they’re here.\n\nGet on the boat, go find them. Expect the unexpected.\n\nJon Holmes is a British broadcaster, comedian and writer whose latest book is ‘A Portrait of an Idiot as a Young Man’ (Orion).

At Rp 10,000 (less than US$1) fare per person, they can conveniently enjoy the festivity\'s atmosphere at night.\n\nVisitors prepare to embark on a river cruise.(JP/Ganug Nugroho Adi)\n\n"Chinese New Year has become a reason to revamp the river.

"Not only Pepe River, but also the Anyar and Jenes rivers."\n\nThree years ago, Pepe River was known to be dirty and dense. Semi-permanent houses could be found lined on its banks here and there. All household waste, as well as industrial waste, were usually thrown directly into the river.\n\n(Read also: West Kalimantan expedition set to explore Indonesia\'s longest river)\n\nThe boats are adorned with red and blue lights to make them more exciting.(JP/Ganug Nugroho Adi)\n\nSince 2014, Surakarta administration started to rejuvenate the small river, which its waters flow toward Bengawan Solo River. In the past two years, it also relocated 340 family heads who lived on the banks to low-cost apartments (rusunawa).\n\nInterestingly, historian Mufti Raharjo said that Pepe River played a big part in the city\'s history as it had been mentioned since the Pajang kingdom era of the mid-16th century. "During those times, Bengawan Solo had 44 merchant ports that were very important for the city\'s trade. One of them was Pepe River port," he said.\n\nToday, hundreds of people could be found strolling the small river\'s banks every night for leisure.\n\n"We\'re really curious about this river tourism. It turned out to be quite exciting—taking a nightly boat ride down the river that has been adorned with lanterns. Hopefully [the decorations] are still here after Chinese New Year," said Retnowati, 22, who hopped on one of the boats with her family.\n\n(Read also: Water puppet shows a must-see for tourists in Vietnam)\n\nHundreds of visitors are said to enjoy the river tourism every night.(JP/Ganug Nugroho Adi)\n\nIrsyad, 34, said he experienced a unique sensation while cruising the river, which reminded him of the time he visited Hoi An River in Vietnam.

Anyone will be happy if the river is clean," he said.\n\nRetno Wulandari, the president of Indonesia Marketing Association’s (IMA) Surakarta Chapter, said it currently was cooperating with hotels to offer Chinese New Year, or Imlek, tourism packages in Surakarta. "Aside from Jakarta and Bandung, visitors from Malaysia and Singapore have also expressed their interest," she said.\n\nAmong the packages is a 8-day, 7-night tour that includes a visit to Yogyakarta and join Grebek Sudiro celebrations; and a three-day, one-night stay in Surakarta, which includes touring Pepe River by boat. "We will continue to offer the river tourism after Imlek; probably available every weekend. Such tourism is not yet available in Surakarta; it will be very interesting," she added.

Gateway Singapore, for example, signifies that the reporter is writing from that city although her coverage of the business of travel will meander to other locales in the region. Read about the series here, and check out all the stories in the series here.\n\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will mark its 50th anniversary in August and the Jakarta-based organization has unimaginatively launched a Visit ASEAN@50: Golden Celebration tourism campaign.\n\nThis is the third Visit ASEAN year. The first was in 1992 when ASEAN turned 25; the second was the odd Visit ASEAN Millennium Year 2002.\n\nMany industry players yawn at another Visit ASEAN Year in a region that has produced a bumper crop of visit years since Thailand did the first in 1980. These include Visit Malaysia Year 1990, Visit Indonesia Year 1991, Visit Myanmar Year 1996, Visit Laos Year 2000, and Visit Vietnam Year 2002.\n\nCritics believe the public sector may be better off focusing on facilitating growth, including working on easing visa restrictions, deregulating the skies, and building tourism infrastructure. On this, ASEAN scores highly ever since it formalised tourism cooperation in 1976 with the formation of a subcommittee on tourism under the ASEAN Committee on Trade and Tourism.\n\nThe Track Record Isn’t Good\n\nBut its efforts at marketing ASEAN as a single yet diverse destination have been slipshod at best.\n\n“They were badly thought-out, with little forward planning,” says David Kevan, a director at tour operator Chic Locations UK which sends luxury clients to Southeast Asia. “In most of Europe, the term ‘ASEAN’ is not widely used or known, especially with customers who are more familiar with Southeast Asia, so it has little publicity value and probably confuses more than assists.”\n\nOne of the problems with the campaign is a a lack of marketing dollars despite tourism contributing a lot to ASEAN’s economy. According to the World Travel Travel & Tourism Council, the 10 ASEAN nations – Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam – depend on tourism to drive their economies more than any other region of the world. Tourism contributed 12.4 percent of the region’s GDP in 2015, when 109 million international arrivals were recorded, and that was 3 to 4 percentage points higher than Europe or the Americas.\n\nYet ASEAN has always been reluctant to disclose how much it spends on marketing the region as a single yet diverse destination. And if anyone is hoping for a real tourism marketing splash this year, so far it’s been modest, comprising an e-brochure of 50 ‘special’ ASEAN multi-destination packages picked by the 10 tourism boards.\n\nThere are promises of media familiarization trips, campaign promotion at key travel trade shows, and cooperative marketing programmes with trade/media, which it already does. The organization also points to upcoming print, online, and social media campaigns and additional public relations and marketing activities throughout 2017.\n\nBut when asked what is the marketing budget for the campaign, there is no reply.\n\nA Very Old-School Approach\n\nAnother problem is that largely an older generation leads the ASEAN bureaucracy. “It (the campaign) will be good but not good enough. The issue is that most of the decision-makers were educated or have work experiences from the 20th century, but now we are in the 21st century,” says Chanin Donavanik, chairman of hotel chain Dusit International, based in Bangkok.\n\nBut the private sector in the region has these decision-makers to thank for facilitating tourism growth in areas that really matter, including ratifying an open-skies agreement that has more than doubled the annual air seat capacity to and within ASEAN countries over the last 10 years, and a visa-free policy for ASEAN nationals. Intra-ASEAN travel accounts for around half of visitors to ASEAN countries and this backyard market, along with China and India, will continue to grow as its middle class bulges and low cost carriers open new routes and offer cheap airfares in the region.\n\nThe organization is also stepping up efforts to develop Southeast Asia cruising, with a joint declaration to “spur port and destination development in the region.”\n\nInfrastructure is a Major Need\n\nASEAN has invested in infrastructure although investment as a share of GDP has not returned to pre-1997 levels in most ASEAN economies, notes Fraser Thompson, director of strategy advisory firm AlphaBeta. “More than $110 billion – roughly two to six times the annual spend – has to be invested yearly to address infrastructure needs.”\n\nThe year 1997 was when the financial crisis in Southeast Asia took hold.\n\nIn building ASEAN’s tourism infrastructure, WTTC ranks the region as only ahead of Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa, with investment requirements differing from country to country. Myanmar, Cambodia and the Philippines, for example, must increase accommodation, airport capacity and tourist facilities, while more established tourism economies such as Indonesia and Singapore need to reinvest, says WTTC.\n\nASEAN also needs to focus on developing more skilled travel and tourism professionals, says Pacific Asia Travel Association CEO Mario Hardy.\n\nThere are enough people but not enough talent to match the industry’s rate of growth. “A region of over 600 million, mostly young and ambitious people, who are embracing technology faster than most other regions, is an enormous opportunity,” added AlphaBeta’s Thompson.\n\nOther sources interviewed point out the need to manage growth — 121 million arrivals are targeted for 2017 — enforce sustainable tourism development practices, diversify sources of arrivals and spread the benefits of tourism to wider communities, all of which require governmental commitment\n\nWith a wish list this long, ASEAN may be better off leaving marketing to the private sector and concentrate on pushing these other goals.\n\nOr, on the other hand, the organization should come up with a respectable marketing budget that tourism deserves and employ real professionals to deal with issues such as branding and marketing for the long term.'),

Of this, around 67 per cent tourist traffic was received by Bali alone,” he said.\n\nThe total international tourists received by Indonesia stood at 12 million in 2016. “We have set a target of welcoming 20 million tourists by the end of 2019. We are working vigorously to reach this,” said Mr. Siringoringo.\n\nHe said Bali, which is the hub of Indonesian tourism, continues to receive the most number of international tourists. While most tourists came from Australia, India stood fifth in terms of the number of visitors.“But it is second only to China, in terms of tourism growth potential. In 2016 a total of 186,638 Indian nationals came to Bali from 118416 in 2015, an increase of 57.61 per cent,” said Mr Siringoringo.\n\nBut, there is much more to Indonesia than Bali. “When people think Indonesia they think Bali, but there are equally good places to visit in Indonesia and we want to promote them. Bali today is overcrowded. To address this we are promoting 10 other destinations. We are making necessary investments for this, including enhancing air connectivity and constructing homestays in the destinations,” he added.\n\nA big step towards this was taken in December last year with the introduction of a flight from Mumbai to Jakarta via Bangkok in December last year. “Though a small flight, the occupancy rate has been 85 to 90 per cent. This is very encouraging for us. We would look to introduce more flights from Delhi and Bengaluru in the future,” Mr. Siringoringo said\n\nIn terms of trade too the Consulate is looking to strength ties with India. “Bilateral trade is around 16 billion US dollars, which is not enough. Despite the large size and rapid growth, the trade and investment between India and Indonesia remains modest. There are only a handful of companies in India, three of which are based in Bengaluru. There is a considerable potential for expanding trade in the areas of automotive components, automobiles, engineering products, IT, pharmaceuticals, bio-technology and healthcare sectors,” he said.\n\nOn Indian companies investing in Indonesia, he said his country welcomed greater investments. “The anual trade expo in Jakarta in October last year saw 115 Indian businessmen participate and the highest investment of close to 5 million USD came from India. We are happy about this and look forward to more investments,” Mr. Siringoringo added.'),

Raudatin, a meeting, incentive, conference, and exhibition (MICE) researcher, Indonesia has the potential to develop its tourism using the bleisure concept, as the country has prospective supporting resources.\n\n\n\nDeveloping tourism by applying this concept can help the country attract investment in the tourism sector. Essentially, investment in the tourism sector is still low, with last years total recorded value reaching only Rp15 trillion.\n\n\n\nChief of the Capital Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) Thomas Lembong revealed on Friday (Feb 17) that in the last five years, the tourism sectors contribution to the total investment reached solely about 2.2 percent, or Rp51.2 trillion of the total investment in the country.\n\n\n\nHence, the BKPM will focus on highlighting the countrys investment potential through the Regional Investment Forum (RIF). It will promote the countrys tourism potential and its supporting infrastructure.\n\n\n\nIn a press statement on Friday, the BKPM head announced that his office will hold the RIF in Nusa Dua, Bali, on February 23, 2017, to promote investment in the tourism sector and its supporting infrastructure.\n\n\n\n"Until now, investment in the tourism sector and its supporting infrastructure is not yet optimal. Hence, we will boost this, so that it will increase," Lembong remarked. Hence, the RIF will highlight the theme: "Investment Promotion in Tourism Industry Sector and Its Supporting Infrastructure."\n\n\n\nIt aims to promote the countrys tourism investment potential to current and prospective foreign and domestic investors.\n\n\n\nThe BKPMs data in 2016 indicated that the value of domestic investment in the tourism sector had reached Rp2.2 trillion, while foreign investment in the same sector stood at Rp12.8 trillion, bringing the total value of investment in the tourism sector last year to Rp15 trillion.\n\n\n\nThis sector has relatively good prospects, as over the last five years, it had recorded an average growth of 18 percent per annum.\n\n\n\nThe BKPM chief, who is also a former trade minister, said that besides encouraging investment in the tourism sector and its supporting infrastructure, his office will also continue to galvanize investment growth outside Java Island.\n\n\n\nThe realization of investment in 2016 indicated that the investment ratio in Java and other parts of Indonesia was recorded at 54 percent as compared to 45 percent.\n\n\n\nThe investment growth outside Java in 2016 was recorded at 22.2 percent, while that in Java stood at only 11 percent. Such growth levels are in line with the directives of President Joko Widodo who is seeking equitable distribution of investment, including investment in the tourism sector and its supporting infrastructure.\n\n\n\nHence, the organizers of RIF will also invite tourism service industries and companies doing business in the infrastructure, banking, and financial services sectors. It laid emphasis on investment for the development of tourism.\n\n\n\nThe forum will also be attended by construction and tourism business associations and the organizers of five tourism special economic zones (SEZ) in the eastern part of Indonesia: the Mandalika SEZ in West Nusa Tenggara, the Morotai SEZ in North Maluku, the Labuan Bajo SEZ in East Nusa Tenggara, the Wakatobi SEZ in Southeast Sulawesi, and the Bunaken SEZ in North Sulawesi.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the tourism sector can attract greater investment by also offering opportunities for the development of infrastructure that will support growth in tourism based on the bleisure concept.\n\n\n\nHence, Christina L. Raudatin, a lecturer and researcher on MICE, suggested Indonesia should develop its tourism using the bleisure concept, as the country has prospective supporting resources in the sector.\n\n\n\n"Now, the bleisure travel concept is expanding. It will be better if the government could develop it maximally," Raudatin stated.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the current mindset in Indonesia is generally limited to merely leisure and pleasure tourism. Thus, the tourism strategies are still limited to development of the leisure segment.\n\n\n\nThe business traveler segment has something different (to offer), with varying characteristics, according to MICE researcher.\n\n\n\nHence, she suggested that Indonesia should start working on the business traveler segment by formulating appropriate strategies, as travelers in this segment have different characteristics.\n\n\n\nBusiness travelers generally seek comfort and support of adequate human resources for the service. Today, we are focusing on leisure but often forget the infrastructure and development of human resources.\n\n\n\nThe travel segment of MICE has the potential to grow, as it is easy to forecast.\n\n\n\n"Every year, most of the events can be forecast," Raudatin noted.\n\n\n\nIndonesia has 16 locations that have become the governments focus for being developed as MICE travel destinations. However, until today, most of the events are still held in Jakarta and Bali, as these two cities are viewed as being the most ready in terms of accessibility and facilities.\n\n\n\nHence, for MICE, the government should focus on some destinations that are already considered ready. Overall, Indonesia has, until now, just about seven destinations that are viewed as MICE travel destinations.\n\n\n\nAccording to Raudatin, in future, more MICE travel destinations would be readied and policies or strategies for the "bleisure" tourism development concept would be put in place. ***3***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(A014/INE)\n\n\n\nEDITED BY INE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(T.A014/A/KR-BSR/F001) 18-02-2017 17:40:07'),

The incentive ranged from US$15 to US$25 per passenger depending on the origin of the flight and the length of the stay.\n\nHowever, despite these attempts to increase tourism to the country, the Indonesian government is still funding sales and marketing for airlines to ensure there are enough seats on chartered flights to handle the 17 million international arrivals that Indonesia aims to receive this year.\n\nCurrently, Indonesia has an average of four million seats on chartered flights and plans to add an extra 1.1 million over the course of the year.\n\nRecently, Indonesia’s Tourism Minister Arief Yahya spoke to airlines at a roadshow, TTG reported.\n\nArief announced the ministry’s desires of adding 600,000 seats for routes to Bali, 350 to Jakarta and the rest spread out over other international ports across Indonesia.\n\n“The government is providing incentives to the airlines in the forms of marketing communications, sales missions, travel marts and fairs,” Arief said.\n\nHaving a \'conversation\' with the Enhaii students in Bandung on Indonesia-China Tourism Cooperation.

These include the Sunda pangolin, painted terrapin, proboscis monkey, Bali mynah and black-winged starling, all of which are on the brink of extinction.\n\nDr Cheng Wen-Haur, deputy CEO and chief life sciences officer, WRS, said, “We have a mission to protect and conserve biodiversity in Singapore and the region, and are happy to report that our animal care team did well in breeding some of the rarest South East Asian animals in 2016. This is but one of the many ways we work on to help save these animals from extinction. We also actively support conservation and research efforts in the animals’ native habitats.”\n\nNine painted terrapins, one of South East Asia’s most endangered freshwater turtle species, hatched in April in Singapore Zoo. The park also welcomed another proboscis monkey baby in April, an endangered primate native to the island of Borneo. Since 1999, Singapore Zoo has seen 30 proboscis monkey births and Singapore claims to the highest number of proboscis monkey births outside of their native Indonesia.\n\nSouth East Asian animal births in Night Safari include Neha, the juvenile Asian elephant born in May. The park also welcomed a fifth birth of the critically endangered Sunda pangolin since 2011, in October. Two Malayan tapirs born in October and December brought up the park’s track record to 30 successful births to date.\n\nThreatened South East Asian species continued to thrive at Jurong Bird Park, with the hatchings of three black-winged starlings and four Bali mynahs, both species critically endangered due to their popularity in the illegal songbird trade. The park works closely with organisations like Begawan Foundation and Cikananga Conservation Breeding Centre in Indonesia who are working to safeguard a population of these rare birds, and to eventually reintroduce them to their native habitats.\n\nSingapore Zoo also welcomed cheetah cub Deka. Born in October, Deka was abandoned by her inexperienced first-time mother. Vets and keepers made the decision to save the cub by hand-raising her. Starting out weak and malnourished, Deka spent her first four days in the animal hospital. Vets and keepers worked to provide round-the-clock care for the next two months until she was strong enough to be independent.\n\nNight Safari’s first pair of fennec foxes successfully bore three kits in November. Kit trio Nia, Nailah and Zaire were also hand-raised after exhibiting minor injuries from mishandling by their mother. Parents Zuri and Izem, the first fennec foxes in the collection across the four wildlife parks, were brought in as confiscations by the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore. Singapore law prohibits the keeping of exotic animals such as fennec foxes. The fox family is set to make its debut in Night Safari’s Creatures of the Night show as animal ambassadors, to educate guests against keeping exotic pets illegally.\n\nWen-Haur added, “Each animal baby born and hatched in our parks is an ambassador in their own right. Individually, they represent their wild counterparts, but collectively they embody the need to conserve not just each individual species but the environment as a whole.”\n\nOver at River Safari, the manatee herd welcomed Joella, a calf born in April. The park’s giant otter family continued to grow with four new additions in March, bringing the total to eight. The park also saw the births of an emperor tamarin, a small primate species, and a trio of ocellate river stingrays, both native to the Amazon Basin.'),

For 2017, Visit Indonesia Tourism Officer (VITO) India, has set a high target of 546,000 Indian arrivals by the end of 2017, an increase of 56% over 2016. An ambitious target is set as there is news that both Garuda Indonesia and AirAsia Indonesia will be coming up with new air connections from India later this year.\n\n\n\nSanjay Sondhi, Country Manager, VITO India highlighted, “We are hoping that Garuda Indonesia will commence a direct flight from Delhi to Jakarta and from one more Indian destination, depending on the demand. Since our 2017 arrival targets from India are ambitious, we are optimistic of better connectivity getting operational from the second half of 2017 by Garuda Indonesia. Their return flight from Jakarta to Mumbai includes a short stopover, at Bangkok, for refuelling. The carrier also aims to make it a non-stop, subject to load factor. Even AirAsia Indonesia has expressed interest in starting a flight from Mumbai and Kolkata to Bali’s capital Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur.”\n\n\n\nHe added that with these upcoming connections, they aim to further leverage wedding and film tourism from the India market. “We are at the initial stage of taking the representatives from film production units to Indonesia. For Film Tourism, VITO is open to provide on-ground facilitation and is willing to discuss on value additions for incentive travel groups,” he confirmed.\n\n\n\n“As of now, India ranks as the second topmost inbound market for Bali and sixth for Indonesia on the whole. This year VITO is eyeing 56% growth in inbound travel from India. To cater to the growing demand, Indonesia Tourism is boosting the number of homestay accommodations in the destination and standardising them, thereby benefiting the local community,” said Dalton Sembiring, Minister, Deputy Chief of Mission, Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia, New Delhi.\n\n\n\nAlso, keeping in mind the young and active holidayers from India, VITO is now promoting 10 new destinations-Lake Toba; Tanjung Kelayang; Tanjung Lesung; Kepulauan Seribu; Borobudur; Bromo Tengger Semeru; Mandalika; Labuan Bajo; Wakatobi and Morotai, spreading awareness beyond Bali and Jakarta. Travellers can dive into diverse experiences at these places.\n\n\n\nThe next VITO Roadshow will be held in Ahmedabad and Pune in the month of August.\n\n\n\nVITO is also looking forward to showcase destination Indonesia on the various digital platforms. This will be done once the budget is allotted in the next fiscal year. Receive the best of Travel content in your mailbox.\n\n\n\nWeekly e-Newsletter'),

The country is blessed with serene natural beauty, unique and rich culture and local traditions, and one of most mega-biodiverse regions in the world.\n\nThe government has set a target to receive 15 million foreign tourists this year and 20 million by 2019.

So far, we have been more responsive," Lembong stated.\n\nPreviously unknown regions in Indonesia have now started receiving tourists, hence adequate infrastructure facilities, such as hotels, are needed to support the tourism industry, he noted.\n\nHe cited Manado in North Sulawesi as an example of a city experiencing a significant increase in tourist arrivals. Some 12 thousand Chinese tourists annually visited Manado, and now, the city receives 12 thousand Chinese visitors monthly.\n\nThe agency will offer the KLIK program to investors to build hotels in Manado and other regions, such as West Sumatra and Belitung.\n\nBeing relatively close to Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia, as well as several Middle Eastern nations, West Sumatra and Belitung are potential tourist destinations, as compared to Bali and Lombok in West Nusa Tenggara.\n\nBesides this, the government also plans to build an airport in North Bali, since the existing Ngurah Rai International Airport is quite crowded, and Bali remains the countrys main tourist destination.\n\nThe agency has launched 18 KLIK industrial zones in 16 districts and cities located in 10 provinces across Indonesia, bringing their total number to 32.\n\nMost of the projects in the KLIK industrial zones are in the manufacturing sector.\n\nThe agency is expanding the coverage of the KLIK program to include the tourism and commercial sectors.\n\nSynergy between the central government and local administrations in needed to speed up licensing services for the implementation of the program.\n\nMeanwhile, investment realization in Indonesia had reached Rp612.8 trillion in 2016, surpassing the set target of Rp594.8 trillion.\n\n"The realization of investment from January to December 2016 had reached Rp612.8 trillion, increasing by 12.4 percent, as compared to Rp545.4 trillion in 2015," Azhar Lubis, the deputy for capital investment implementation control of BKPM, stated recently.\n\nLubis explained that the realization of domestic investment was recorded at Rp216.2 trillion, up 20.5 percent, while foreign investment realization reached Rp396.6 trillion, or an increase of 8.4 percent.\n\nThe upcoming visit of Saudi Arabian King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, with his entourage of 1.5 thousand people, is a good opportunity for Indonesia to promote investment in the tourism sector.\n\nMinister Yahya had earlier informed the press that King Salmans agenda included a visit to Bali on Mar 4-9 for a private vacation after he concludes his state visit to Jakarta on Mar 3.\n\n"This is a golden opportunity for Indonesia to promote tourism.

After a 12 metre descent, my feet finally touched the ground again. Then I walked along for another 15 metres before reaching a second vertical drop. I had to repeat this another two more times before reaching the rock-face – almost 100 metres or so underground – by which stage I was sweating profusely and gasping for air on a makeshift hose linked to an oxygen tank.”\n\nHaving dropped out of school after a bout of typhus, Fernando spent much of the next six years working in the many illegal gold mines located across his home province of North Sulawesi and neighbouring Gorontalo in Indonesia.\n\nBetween stints away from his village of Kanonang, he helped his landless farmer parents try to make a living in the rain-drenched hills two hours to the southwest of the bustling provincial capital of Manado, now touted as a second Bali.\n\nThe landscape, with its bamboo groves, rice paddies and fruit orchards, appears lush and verdant.\n\nHowever, the reality is more complex and making a decent living is extremely tough, especially for the landless, as Fernando explains: “Planting a hectare of groundnuts means renting the land first and then investing in seed, labour and fertiliser. A hectare of tomatoes would require over 40 million rupiah (HK$23,000) in capital. If prices crash just before the harvest, you’ll end up losing money.\n\n“That’s why so many people join the illegal mining. You earn cash even though there were many times when I thought I could have died. I would end up praying, knowing that my life was in hands of the Lord.”\n\nIn a breezy, light-hearted manner, he recounts how he started: “I was recovering from typhus when one of my uncles asked if I’d like to join him in the mines. I said yes and followed. We were cheated by the boss on the first job but after that I started earning good money – at least 1.5 million rupiah a month.”\n\n“We worked as a team. We were loyal to our mates. not the bosses. We looked after each other because our lives depended on it – torang samua ba’sudara’ (we are all brothers).”\n\n“We didn’t just dig for gold. We were also responsible for crushing and processing the ore. Then we had to mix it with water and mercury. If there was gold, it would solidify then we’d have to separate the mercury by hand using muslin cloth.”\n\nHe said the work was hazardous, bit only if he touched it. “I never drank the mercury!”\n\nWhile the work was exhausting and at times dangerous, it paid off: “I bought my first motorbike outright for 16 million rupiah cash,” he said proudly.\n\nBut mining was not exactly a cushy job. Injuries were frequent his crew was attacked by a group of thugs in Gorontalo in 2015.\n\n“By then I had had enough. That’s when I decided to stay at home and become a tour guide in between helping my parents. Now at least my mother has her own home and we keep pigs as well. When they’re big we can sell them for 7 to 8 million rupiah a head.”\n\nFernando’s personal prospects are also improving.\n\nInvestments in infrastructure have opened up eastern Indonesia just as lifestyle trends emphasising “adventure” tourism have captured the popular imagination.\n\nEven notoriously picky Jakartans have started exploring beyond Singapore and Bali, visiting the islands of Sumba, Wakatobi and Seram in ever-larger numbers.\n\nCertainly, foreign visitor numbers into Manado are rising, North Sulawesi received 40,624 foreign tourists in 2016 compared to 19,465 and 17,279 in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n\nIn 2016, around 30,000 Chinese tourists visited Manado and this is expected to increase to 150,000 this year due to increased flights from the mainland.\n\nNow married and working part-time as a tour guide at local visitor attraction called Bukit Kasih, Fernando recognises the changing trends: “There’s not much work up here in the mountains. You need a high school diploma to get a decent job which is why I’m hoping the government will relaunch their ‘Programme C’ (a back-to-school initiative that helps former drop-outs complete high school). I’m convinced that tourism offers a better future. Look at how it’s transformed Bali.”\n\nIn keeping with the Minahasan tradition of venturing out (merantau), Fernando’s ambitions are not limited to his island: “Many Minahasans travel around the country for work. There are lots of us in Papua, especially at the Freeport mine and also in Sorong. I’d like to go to Raja Ampat and learn how to become a guide for all the water attractions.”\n\nThe influx of infrastructure and tourists, however, presents its own set of challenges. Authenticity is increasingly key in tourism.\n\nMoving forward, young Minahasans such as Fernando must maintain the uniqueness of their culture if Manado is to remain a sustainable, vibrant destination.'),

There\'s halal food in all areas," he said.\n\nIndonesia aims to more than double the number of Muslim tourists it received last year to 5 million by 2019, said the head of the Indonesian tourism ministry\'s Halal Tourism Development and Acceleration team.\n\n"Other than the large number of potential visitors from Muslim countries, their spending power is also larger," said Riyanto Sofyan, noting Muslim tourists spend around $1,700 per visit, compared to $1,100 on average by other foreigners.\n\nCamel rides\n\nOn the approach to Nusa Dua, a peninsula on the southern tip of Bali where the king is staying, police in fluorescent vests checked cars at an impromptu checkpoint.\n\nWhile not especially brought in for the Saudi visitors, the beach at Nusa Dua does have something to make the visitors feel right at home — camels.\n\nMinarto, who runs camel rides in front of the Hilton Bali Resort, said the Saudi group had requested 100 half-hour rides.\n\n"We\'re busy and they wanted too many.

Lack of promotion is reason why relatively few Middle Eastern tourists visit Bali. Usually, Middle Eastern tourists learn about Indonesia through word-of-mouth (through a friend or family member who has been in Southeast Asia\'s largest economy). It is interesting to note that Middle Eastern tourists have more spending power compared to other foreign tourists, and therefore they are a valuable asset in terms of foreign exchange earnings. On average the spending power of a Middle Eastern tourist is twice as much compared to other foreign tourists\' spending power.\n\nRead more: King Salman of Saudi Arabia to Visit Indonesia in Early March\n\n\n\nIndonesian news portal Tempo reports relatively few Middle Eastern tourists visit Bali as they usually prefer the Puncak area in West Java, a mountain pass that is famous for its beautiful tea plantations and forests. Due to the big amount of tourists from the Middle East who visit this Puncak area each year, you will see many signs (of restaurants, hotels and shops) in the Arabic language rather than in Indonesian or English. This area is in fact nicknamed "Arab Village" due to the quantity of Middle Eastern tourists.\n\nRead more: Overview of the Tourism Sector in Indonesia\n\nAlthough the number of Middle Eastern tourists in Indonesia is rising it only forms a "small piece of the cake". In 2016 a total of 186,654 Middle Eastern tourists visited Indonesia, up from 160,696 in the preceding year. This figure is, however, small compared to the total of 12.2 million foreign tourists who visited the world\'s largest archipelago in 2016. By far, most foreign tourists who visit Indonesia come from Singapore, China and Malaysia.\n\nMany Middle Eastern tourists visit Puncak as this area is now known among Middle East communities as the tourist attraction in Indonesia. However, local sources say it is a public secret that Middle Eastern tourists are attracted by the Puncak because of the "short marriage facility". Tourists can marry Indonesian women unofficially (these women usually originate from Cianjur or Sukabumi) for a short period of time (several weeks or months) and then depart back to the Middle East leaving their unofficial Indonesian "spouse" behind in Puncak (who sometimes become pregnant). For the women this is a good deal as they are paid at least IDR 15 million (approx. USD $1,100) per month, far above the regional minimum wage.\n\nLocal sources further inform that many of the Indonesian women who become the temporary wife of a foreign tourist actually already have an Indonesian husband. However, not unoften, the Indonesian husband supports this facility as it will lead to significant income for the household. In fact, for some women it is a career as they serve one or two "clients" every year.\n\nUsually in the month of May, there occurs a significant rise in arrival of Middle Eastern tourists in the Puncak area, locally known as the start of the "Arab season" (May-August). For the local economy this period is lucrative: most of the villas are occupied, while local restaurants, shops, and car rentals generate more income.\n\nShare this column\n\n‹ Back to Today\'s Headlines'),

However, such customary rules are inadequate. The abundant fish stocks in Raja Ampat waters have made the region a target for illegal fishing. Therefore, a surveillance system set up by the authorities is also needed.\n\nA recent incident of a cruise ship smashed into and destroyed coral reefs in Raja Ampat is believed to be caused by the lack of monitoring and coordination among local authorities.\n\nDespite the importance of the zones and its surveillance system , the local government has not yet recognized.\n\n“So far no regulation has yet been issued to recognize their ownership rights to the communal property,” said Raja Ampat Regent Abdul Faris Umlati.\n\nThe local communities’ declarations in Raja Ampat won’t be observed as they should be unless the local government gives its recognition in a binding regulation.\n\nThe recognition of the zones by the local government will maximize the protection of sea biodiversity and the environment, which is expected to attract more tourists to the region.\n\nAbout 15,000 tourists (including 6,000 domestic vacationers) visited Raja Ampat in 2016. Foreign tourists must pay Rp 1 million (US$74.72) and local visitors Rp 500,000 in levies to visit the Raja Ampat territory.\n\nDespite the figures, the region still suffered a deficit of at least $1.4 million annually on average for monitoring the area.\n\nIncome from tourist visits is expected to meet the deficit from the surveillance costs for the traditional conservation zones.\n\nTherefore, several nongovernmental organizations like Conservation International, the World Wildlife Fund and the Nature Conservancy strive to cover the shortage by forming a perpetual fund called the Blue Abadi Fund. So far, they have collected $23 million of their target of $38 million from donors, philanthropists and central and regional governments.\n\nBut water conservation is not sufficient without land protection.\n\n“Indonesia will never succeed in managing its waters without seriously protecting its landscape as well,” indicated Ketut. According to him, gorgeous marine zones with their lavish features of biodiversity will certainly attract increasing numbers of tourists and coral reefs will continue thriving if forests are well maintained.\n\nThis year, with a planned ferry service and a direct flight from Manado by Wings Air, the total number of tourists is expected to reach 20,000.'),

Here are the instructions how to enable JavaScript in your web browser .\n\nThe title of this story was going to be different. It was going to be, "Why I\'ve never been to Bali". But then I remembered that I have actually been to Bali.\n\nIt was only for two days, for a hotel opening back in 2012, and I\'d kind of forgotten that it ever happened. Clearly, Bali made a large impression on me. I\'ve been there? Right.\n\nSee Also Bali travel guide\n\nSo yes, technically, I have been to Bali. But I haven\'t seen Bali. I haven\'t properly experienced this insanely popular island. I haven\'t witnessed the good and the bad there: the surf beaches, the spirituality, the great food and the hospitable people, contrasted with the deluge of Australians, the Bintang-singlet-wearing masses who arrive on the island\'s shores day after day after day to live it up on the cheap.\n\nI\'m in the minority here, I realise, because most Australians have seen Bali, and most seem to have enjoyed it. This Indonesian island is one of the most popular destinations for Australian travellers, a perennial favourite that seems to have eased its way over speedbumps such as terror attacks and volcanic ash clouds and the tall poppy syndrome of the tourism cycle to remain incredibly popular.\n\nLast year, 1.18 million Australians travelled to Indonesia, and most of those holidaying headed to Bali. Only New Zealand, with 1.42 million Australian visitors, could top that number. Clearly, there\'s something going on here.\n\nAnd yet, I\'ve never felt the pull. I\'ve been to some pretty out-there places around the world, 83 countries in total, and done some pretty out-there things – searched for gorillas in the Democratic Republic of Congo; bought black-market caviar in Azerbaijan; slept in a ger in Mongolia; sailed all the way to Antarctica – but I\'ve never properly been to Bali, possibly one of the easiest and most enjoyable destinations of all.\n\nSo, what gives? You have to examine something like that, figure out what\'s going on. Why, if I\'m so curious about the world, and so keen to visit absolutely everywhere to see it with my own eyes and judge for myself, have I never really bothered to go to Bali?\n\nI think there are a few reasons, though they can mostly be summed up by the idea that I\'m just not that into all of the things that Bali is supposed to be about.\n\nI\'m not a particularly spiritual person. I don\'t travel to look inwards at myself, or to question the greater universe, or the feel the energy of a devout people. That\'s not really my thing. I don\'t do yoga. I try to keep my temple and church visits to a minimum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBali, as far as I can tell, is a spiritual destination. That spirituality probably manifests itself in many different ways that have nothing to do with temples or white people doing yoga, but still, it\'s not a reason I would travel somewhere. I need more than that to attract me.\n\nI don\'t surf, either. I really like the beach, I like swimming and hanging out near the ocean, but I also live right near a few of the world\'s finest beaches, so it\'s going to take more than that to lure me somewhere on holidays.\n\nI don\'t like big beach resorts. I get bored quickly just lying in the sun. Tropical destinations, for those reasons, are usually low on my hit-list – when I travel, I want something that\'s different to home.\n\nI\'m also not much of a fan of Australian bogan-dom. I realise it\'s a cliché to sum up all Australian visitors to Bali as bogans, and that there are travellers from all walks of life who go there for all sorts of reasons, but surely you can\'t deny that a good chunk of Aussies who visit Bali sport southern cross tattoos and wear Ugg boots outside the house.\n\nIt\'s not that I mind meeting other Australians when I\'m travelling – I\'m just not on the lookout for them. I don\'t need other Aussies around me to feel comfortable. And Bali, it seems, already has more than its fair share of Australians without me adding to the mix.\n\nI understand there\'s a strong cultural element to Bali\'s appeal for some people. I have no doubt the food is great if you go to the right places. The hospitality of the Balinese is pretty well known. And I\'m sure you can get away from the madding crowds and find the "real" Bali if you try hard enough.\n\nBut I\'ve never been willing to make that effort. It\'s a big, exciting world out there, and Bali is a fair way down on my list of priorities. I can\'t see that changing.\n\nThough, given the number of Australians who are interested, and who do head over to the island for holiday after holiday, I doubt I\'m being missed.\n\nHave you been to Bali? What do you love about it? Or do you, like me, have no interest in visiting?\n\nEmail: b.groundwater@fairfaxmedia.com.au\n\nInstagram: Instagram.com/bengroundwater\n\nSee also: 20 things that will shock first-time visitors to Bali\n\nSee also: The big, unexpected danger for travellers to south-east Asia'),

However, I told them that the use of an online system is a must. Hence, instead of banning online travel agents, we provide an online travel platform for manual travel agents," Tourism Minister Arief Yahya stated during a workshop titled "The Use of Mobile Positioning Data for Tourism Statistics" held in Nusa Dua, Bali, recently.\n\n\n\nThe use of a manual system has become outdated and might no longer be used, he noted.\n\n\n\nThe Tourism Ministry has organized road shows in several regions to introduce and encourage the tourism industry players, such as hotels, restaurants, theme parks, water parks, car rentals, souvenir shops, airlines, tour operators, tour agents, and tour guides, to join ITX.\n\n\n\nThousands of travel agents have used the free ITX platform. With the ITX Market Place, travel agents do not have to invest individually on digitization.\n\n\n\nThe big data MPD to support tourism activities is collected by Indonesias Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) by detecting the cellular phones used by visitors entering Indonesian territory from several gates, including from land borders with neighboring countries.\n\n\n\nThe BPS has used MPD since October 2016, and it has been useful since several of Indonesias border entry points lack immigration offices.\n\n\n\nOf the 29 districts located in the border regions, 19 lack immigration checkpoints.\n\n\n\nMinister Yahya noted that the MPD system has helped to address the challenges faced by Indonesia, which is an archipelagic nation with multiple border entry points.\n\n\n\n"Data processing can be used for three P aspects: performance, promotion, and projection. MPD is used to measure performance, while Big Data is used for promotion and projection," he revealed.\n\n\n\nThe ministry has set a target to attract 12 million foreign tourists this year and 20 million by 2019.\n\n\n\nThe United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) has lauded Indonesia for achieving a breakthrough by using MPD.\n\n\n\nThe use of MPD to obtain tourism statistics, however, should be supported by in-depth studies, John Kester, director of the Tourism Market Trends Program of UNTWO, pointed out.\n\n\n\n"Detailed studies need to be conducted for us to find our consumers, understand the current trend, and realize the ongoing competition," he noted while speaking at the Bali workshop.\n\n\n\nIn addition to conducting detailed studies, effective strategies are also needed for the successful application of the MPD.\n\n\n\n"There should be reflections, discussions, object determination, planning, executions, and good evaluations," he explained.\n\n\n\nAnother factor that affects the use of MPD is education of the human resources.\n\n\n\nOn February 2, 2017, Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific of UNWTO Xu Jing sent a letter to the Indonesian Tourism Minister lauding the countrys move to use MPD.\n\n\n\nOther countries that use the MPD system include Spain, Estonia, Belgium, and the Netherlands.\n\n\n\nAt the local level, Banyuwangi District in East Java has also utilized information technology to promote its tourist destinations.\n\n\n\nAzwar Anas, the Banyuwangi district head, launched an android-based tourism and culinary application called "Banyuwangi in Your Hand" on Mar 23.\n\n\n\n"Banyuwangi In Your Hand is an innovation to offer convenience to the tourists visiting Banyuwangi. At the same time, it is in accordance with the tourism industrys market trend to bring about digitization in all areas," Anas stated.\n\n\n\nThe application uses augmented and virtual reality formats that can be viewed as videos, animation, and 3D. The application is also connected to Google Maps.\n\n\n\n"This application will help the tourists visiting Banyuwangi for the first time, in particular. The application will show details of tourist attractions in Banyuwangi," he noted.\n\n\n\nYanuar Bramuda, head of the Banyuwangi tourist office, remarked that the "Banyuwangi in Your Hand" application will be connected to similar applications, such as "Europe in Your Hand" and "Australia in Your Hand," to promote Banyuwangi in Europe and Australia.\n\n\n\nLocated in the eastern tip of Java Island, Banyuwangi is also blessed with scenic beaches and mountains.\n\n\n\nIjen Crater located in the western part of Banyuwangi is famous for its scenic crater lake, the traditional sulfur miners who scale and descend the slopes of Mount Merapi, and the plantations covering the craters slopes.\n\n\n\nThe National Park of Meru Betiri is famous for Javan tigers and turtles.\n\n\n\nBanyuwangi, termed as "the Sunrise of Java," had attracted some 80 thousand foreign tourists and 3.2 million domestic tourists last year owing to various festivals organized to promote tourism.\n\n\n\nLast year, Banyuwangi had planned at least 58 festivals, including 20 new events, such as the Canal Rafting Festival, Sailing Ship Festival, Underwater Festival, and Badeng River Tubing Festival, in addition to the Paddy Planting Festival and Fishery Festival, Anas pointed out.\n\n\n\nThis year, Banyuwangi has planned to hold 72 activities to enliven the 2017 Banyuwangi Festival.\n\n(T.F001/INE/KR-BSR/B003)\n\n'),

The list includes Wakatobi in Southeast Sulawesi, Morotai in North Maluku and the Thousand Islands in Jakarta.\n\nWith ongoing plans to develop infrastructure and amenities in selected locations, attract more investment and advance tourism, Indonesia appears on track to achieving its ambitious target of attracting 20 million visitors annually by 2019.\n\nGovernment officials have been vigorously promoting these locations ever since, while President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo has been raising the matter in his meetings with foreign leaders and business groups abroad as part of efforts to attract both tourists and investments.\n\nThe Ministry of Tourism also actively engaged in various promotional efforts, with Wonderful Indonesia billboards in Times Square in New York and Shibuya Crossing in Tokyo.\n\nDespite continuous eruptions of Mount Agung in Bali since last year, Indonesia welcomed 14 million foreign tourists in 2017 – an increase of almost 22 percent from the year before, though still short of the 15-million target.\n\nThe shift from Bali as the country\'s main tourist destination is expected to aid plans to attract more foreign tourists, which is expected to boost foreign-exchange earnings and increase employment.\n\nThe World Travel and Tourism Council estimates that Indonesia\'s current efforts to develop its tourism industry will help generate 2.4 million new jobs in the country.\n\nThe Tourism Ministry said in November last year that development will be refocused on four of the original 10 locations. These are Lake Toba in North Sumatra, Borobudur in Central Java, Mandalika in West Nusa Tenggara and Labuan Bajo in East Nusa Tenggara.\n\nCoordinating Maritime Affairs Minister Luhut Pandjaitan said efforts to develop these locations would be integrated to make the results more effective and eliminate mistakes as far as possible.\n\nVarious efforts have also been directed at promoting these areas a "digital destinations" to further popularize them on social media.\n\nWhile the natural beauty of these priority destinations is undisputed, what has the government been doing to facilitate a better experience for visitors to these locations?\n\nLake Toba\n\nAs part of efforts to turn Lake Toba into an international-standard destination, the government has improved access to the area by upgrading the nearest airport. Silangit International Airport in North Tapanuli, North Sumatra, started to serve direct flights from Singapore and Malaysia in October last year. It previously took travelers around five hours to reach Lake Toba from Kualanamu International Airport outside Medan.\n\nA view of Silangit International Airport in North Tapanuli district, North Sumatra. (JG Photo/Telly Nathalia)\n\nLake Toba, which has launched a bid to become a Unesco-designated Global Geopark, will take adopt the concept of nomadic tourism, especially as a means to improve amenities.\n\n"We are realizing this nomadic tourism concept with a pilot project at Lake Toba, and a groundbreaking event is scheduled for April. Once it starts, we will also develop it in other priority destinations," Tourism Minister Arief Yahya said, as quoted by BeritaSatu.com.\n\nThe nomadic tourism concept will likely focus on accommodation, with plans to provide a "caravan hotel" that will allow tourists to visit different areas without having to worry about accommodation. Arief said this should be a solution to provide quality accommodation for the time being, while accredited hotels are being built for years to come.\n\nLocal communities are also encouraged to provide quality homestay experiences for visitors, as part of an integrated approach that seeks to preserve the natural beauty of Lake Toba while developing the area into a thriving tourism destination.\n\nThe government said in November that 40 foreign investors, including from Singapore and China, had expressed an interest in developing the Lake Toba area.\n\nThe government also established the Lake Toba Authority Agency to easy the investment process.\n\nLabuan Bajo\n\nKomodo National Park, a Unesco World Heritage Site where visitors can see komodo dragons in their natural habitat, is located on one of Labuan Bajo\'s three main islands.\n\nKomodo Island was declared one of the new seven wonders of nature in 2011.\n\nThe hills of Labuan Bajo and the surrounding waters have started to feature on Instagram, further enchanting travelers to visit this destination, which was relatively unknown until just a few years ago.\n\nThe waters of Labuan Bajo offer some of the best diving spots in Indonesia, while visitors can also view a rare phenomenon – Pink Beach on Komodo Island.\n\nThe increasing popularity of Labuan Bajo has in recent times seen an influx of investment into the area.\n\nThe upcoming 2018 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, scheduled to take place in Nusa Dua, Bali, in October, is expected to attract around 15,000 participants from 189 countries. The proximity and increasing popularity of Labuan Bajo and neighboring Mandalika as tourist destinations are likely to see many of the participants extend their visits.\n\nIn Labuan Bajo, the government is working to improve access to water and electricity, building roads and another port, as well as speeding up development of an international airport. Officials hope to finalize these before the start of the event.\n\nMandalika\n\nIn Mandalika, situated on Lombok Island in West Nusa Tenggara, tourists can visit two traditional villages of the Sasak tribe to experience ancient traditions. Besides the villages – Sade and Ende – the area also provides beautiful views of the hills and sea.\n\nAnd in addition to Mount Rinjani and the Gili Islands, Lombok also has the 1,034-hectare Mandalika Special Economic Zone.\n\nThe special economic zone, which was inaugurated in October last year, is focused on agriculture and ecotourism and will be used to promote the culture and economy in the province. The area will serve to help popularize local architecture, traditional crafts and cuisine.\n\nSimilar to neighboring Labuan Bajo, waste has been one of the main issues, which prompted the government and the local community to combine efforts to address this and preserve the area. These efforts included cleanup actions and campaigns to educate local residents.\n\nBeritaSatu.com reported that during their visit to Qatar in December last year, Minister Luhut and West Nusa Tenggara Governor Muhammad Zainul Madji invited investors from the Gulf state to invest in Mandalika.\n\nThese investments are needed to expand Lombok International Airport, build roads and develop supporting facilities, such as hotels.\n\nBorobudur\n\nDevelopment of this destination in Central Java has largely been coordinated by the Borobudur Tourism Authority Board (BOB), which oversees tourism in the area.\n\nThe BOB has reportedly been coordinating with stakeholders in surrounding destinations such as Sangiran, an archaeological site, and Karimun Jawa, a small archipelago near Semarang, in an effort to diversify tourism attractions in the province.\n\nInfrastructure developments include new highways between Bawen and Yogyakarta and Semarang and Solo, renovations of Achmad Yani International Airport in Semarang and construction of Yogyakarta\'s new Kulonprogo Airport.\n\nThe regional government is also revitalizing the iconic Jalan Malioboro in Yogyakarta.\n\nAccording to a report by Investor Daily, there are currently 17 tourist villages in Yogyakarta.

The government of Indonesia, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is ready and will continue to market and promote the nations tourism potential, including that of West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) Province.\n\n\n\nNTB comprises several islands, including Sumbawa in the north and Lombok in the west, which offer several holiday destinations to tourists from across the world.\n\n\n\nLombok is famous for its scenic beaches and underwater beauty that enable NTB to offer a whole lot more.\n\n\n\nApart from the beaches, the mountainous areas of the province are a beacon for adventure enthusiasts, with Mount Rinjani, the second-highest volcano in Indonesia, famous for its caldera situated to the west of the summit.\n\n\n\nHence, Foreign Affairs Minister Retno Marsudi has expressed readiness to market and promote the tourism potential of NTB abroad.\n\n\n\n"Speaking of NTB, it certainly has beautiful natural scenery, combined with a highly religious society," Marsudi stated in the provincial city of Mataram on Friday.\n\n\n\nThe foreign affairs minister reiterated her readiness to promote NTBs tourism potential abroad, since she opined that the provinces blend of natural beauty and religion had drawn accolades, as was apparent by the fact that the area was adjudged the best Halal tourist destination in the world.\n\n\n\nLombok Island in NTB has been recognized as the worlds best Halal tourism and honeymoon destination, a feat that should have led to an increase in Halal certification for hotels and restaurants in the province.\n\n\n\nHence, hotels and restaurants in the province should immediately obtain Halal certification that would help them attract tourists from Middle Eastern and other Muslim countries.\n\n\n\nHalal certificates are issued by the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), the countrys highest authority on Islamic affairs, in cooperation with the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Assessment Agency (LPPOM) and the Department of Industry and Trade.\n\n\n\nLPPOM is an institution under MUI responsible for conducting Halal examination, audit, and assessment.\n\n\n\nCurrently, acquiring a Halal certification is optional, but Indonesian lawmakers are trying to push for the enactment of a Halal Product Protection Bill which, if passed by the House of Representatives, will make it mandatory to ensure that all products are Halal certified before they reach the market.\n\n\n\nMoreover, currently, the Mandalika Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in NTB holds immense potential and is being developed as a new tourist destination in the Central Lombok District.\n\n\n\nThe development of the Mandalika SEZ is being currently accelerated to boost economic growth in Indonesia, particularly in the province of NTB.\n\n\n\nHence, the Indonesian government will continue to speed up the development of the Mandalika SEZ to become one of the leading tourism destinations in the surrounding areas, such as the island resort of Bali and NTBs Komodo Island.\n\n\n\nVice President Jusuf Kalla had once remarked that the local communities should be trained in hospitality skills, such as service with a smile and also about maintaining cleanliness.\n\n\n\nKalla noted that tourist attractions in various regions in the country had drawn several foreign tourists, but innovation was the key to attracting more investment.\n\n\n\nTourism is the easiest means of attracting investment, as it does not require huge capital, Kalla pointed out, adding that the main capital given freely by God is the beautiful natural landscape and the hospitable behavior of the residents around the tourism site.\n\n\n\nHence, the vice president noted that the best approach to develop tourism is to bring about innovation as he believes there are several places in the country that are considered usual and mediocre but are of immense interest to foreigners.\n\n\n\nSeveral hotels are being constructed at the Mandalika SEZ by PT Indonesia Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC), which is a state-owned enterprise in the field of tourism.\n\n\n\nIn addition to building hotels, ITDC will also build the basic infrastructure needed by hotels to support their operations, such as the need for clean water that will be met by utilizing seawater through a desalination process.\n\n\n\nThis task is being carried out by establishing partnership with EBD Bauer, one of the US companies engaged in the desalination of seawater into fresh water.\n\n\n\nOther infrastructure in the process of being set up include a solar power plant and gas power plants for hotels in the Mandalika SEZ that will not use electrical energy from the State Electricity Company (PLN).\n\n\n\nThus, some 20 star-rated hotels will be built in the Mandalika SEZ within two decades. For the first stage, the company will build four five-star hotels, and it has prepared the basic infrastructure.\n\n\n\nITDC is also building the Tourism College, which will help to train human resources needed by hotels.\n\n\n\nFollowing completion, the SEZ of Mandalika resort will be able to employ more than 58 thousand workers.\n\n\n\nDuring the construction period, the number of workers is forecast to increase by two to three folds and will help to reduce the flow of Indonesian workers abroad.\n\n(T.O001/INE/KR-BSR/H-YH)'),

This is because the damaged reef is just one of many diving spots in the area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said visitors can still choose to dive in more than 200 coral reefs which are still pristine. On Mar 4, a cruise ship, the Caledonian Sky, ran aground during low tide at a popular dive spot known as Crossover Reef.\n\n\n\nThe Bahamas-flagged vessel is owned by a Swedish company, and the passengers booked their cruise in Britain.

Authorities are assessing the total damage to the coral reef to determine how much compensation to ask from parties responsible.\n\n\n\nIt is believed that much of the damage was caused when the ship\'s captain attempted to free the vessel after it ran aground on the reef.\n\n\'IT\'S HURTING IN YOUR BONES\'\n\nAs a result of the accident, the government is expected to review regulations to prevent a similar occurrence in future.\n\n\n\n"Why did they (local authorities) release the vessel when we haven’t finished preliminary investigations?” said Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs Luhut Pandjaitan.\n\n\n\n“Why did the ship move in that area (after running aground), damaging more coral reefs? There are many questions we have to respond to."\n\n\n\nEven though tourists have not been deterred from visiting Raja Ampat, many have expressed regret over what happened.\n\n\n\n"You feel like it\'s hurting in your bones,” said Leo Berkhof, a visitor from the Netherlands. “Be careful with nature; this is one of the last spots in the world where the corals are very beautiful."\n\n\n\nIndonesian visitor Novita Dewi Kumalasari believes there should be lessons learnt.\n\n\n\n"The coral reefs in Raja Ampat are rare, and too expensive to even compensate with money," she said.\n\n\n\nBesides the impact on tourism, the incident may also affect villagers living close to where the cruise ship ran aground.\n\n\n\n"There’s also the impact on social values,” said Yusdi. “The people in Raja Ampat are very protective of their environment.

One of the identified places for this project was Mandalika on Lombok Island.\n\nIn order to put this effort into fast drive, the government also introduced a visa-free tourism policy which covered inbound travelers coming from more than a 100 different countries. Clearance approval was also eliminated for yachts entering the Indonesian territory and the cabotage policy was deregulated for international cruise ships.\n\nSlowly and steadily, Lombok, located in West Nusa Tenggara, has grown to become extremely popular with international students, suggests a Central Statistics Agency (BPS) report. Over 7, 3000 foreign tourists traveled to Indonesia in March 2016 indicating an increase of 22.52 percent when compared to the travel statistics from March 2015.\n\nThe Green Future\n\nIn 2016, a government-owned organization took on the responsibility to develop tourism in the beautiful Indonesian location Mandalika, located in Lombok. The project included the building of infrastructure including solar power plants, water treatment facilities and roads.\n\nUnder ITDC’s masterplan, the solar power plant will utilize the land under the solar panels as a greenhouse to grow crops organically. The company will develop the solar power plant in stages and targets it to reach full capacity by 2019.\n\nTo support the vision of the Mandalika development, an internal transportation system is to be designed in synergy with the concept. The electric train will be the alternative for an eco-friendly transportation solution. Embracing the natural setting, there will be a cable car for public recreational transport.\n\nSolar cell energy and hybrid technology usage are in the plans. The power plant, which occupies up to 50ha of land, will help supply half of the resort’s power demand, projected to reach 110 megawatts by 2025. However, the 1st phase construction period will be 6-9 months.\n\nDevelopment of Hotels in Mandalika\n\nTalking about development plans in Mandalika, Edwin Darmasetiawan, from Indonesia Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC), was reported saying that the company had also begun constructing the Mandalika Grand Mosque so that KEK Mandalika could also welcome Muslims.\n\nEdwin was reported saying that almost 1,500 hotel room might become operational by 2018 under the Mandalika project. The hotel rooms will be provided by numerous hotels including Club Med, Pullman, Marriott by EBD Bauer and Tulip (Lee Group).\n\nIncreased Opportunities for Lombok Investment\n\nAccording to ITDC, the development of hotels is critical for building Mandalika Resort, which is on its last development stage. Mandalika Resort will offer around 10, 533 rooms to its guests. ITDC’s vision is to create a sophisticated tourist destination and therefore Mandalika would be home to several large hotels with popular brand names. This is sure to make Lombok a lucrative investment destination among investors from diverse backgrounds.\n\nThe natural beauty of Mandalika and the availability of boutique resorts will make for the perfect retreat for tourists.

The airlines need to increase their number of available seats by 4 million this year, 3.5 million next year and other 3 million by 2019 to meet the government\'s tourist arrival target.\n\nArief said there are several airport improvements in the pipeline to meet rising passenger numbers, such as the rapid exit runway and apron in Bali, runway, taxiway and apron developments at several airports, including at the country\'s busiest, Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Banten.\n\nA total of 11.5 million foreign tourists visited Indonesia last year, which is an 11 percent increase from a year earlier, according to data from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS).

Up to now, only the cultural aspect has been examined, with the economic and environmental factors not yet touched on. This time the three elements must be synchronized so that tourism development does not only eliminate only poverty, but becomes the largest contributor of foreign exchange for the nation,” Arief said.\n\nHe also said tourism would be the largest contributor of foreign exchange by 2019, beating oil and gas, coals and crude palm oil (CPO).\n\n“Indonesia has been doing well in Sustainable Tourism Development. We sit in second place, after China,” said the minister, who has been known to use the acronym ECE in place of CEE in order to prioritize the environment.\n\nAmong the attendees at the coordination meeting were I Gede Ardika, head of the Sustainable Tourism Development Acceleration Task Force and Frans Teguh, Tourism Ministry Infrastructure and Ecosystem Development assistant deputy. Heads of tourism from various provinces also attended the meeting, including Lalu M. Faozal from West Nusa Tenggara and those from Sleman. Heads of tourism representing various regencies were also among the attendees, including those from Samosir regency, West Lombok regency, Pangandaran regency and Denpasar.\n\n(Read also: Indonesian Tourism Ministry promotes diving at Tokyo Marine Diving Fair)\n\nThe meeting was also attended by a tourism association in Lombok as well as scholars represented by Prof. M.

We’ll share management knowledge on indicators and strategic issues regarding sustainable tourism practices.”\n\nTo accelerate Sustainable Tourism Development in Indonesia, the tourism ministry has already launched the Monitoring Center for Sustainable Tourism Observatories, a method used to help improve the quality of destinations.\n\nIn 2017, the ministry established five monitoring centers, the first one being the University of North Sumatra (USU) Monitoring Center, which encompasses the Samosir regency. This was followed by the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) Monitoring Center with Pangandaran regency as its focus of observation. Gajah Mada University (UGM) Monitoring Center observes Sleman regency, Udayana University (Unud) Monitoring Center observes Denpasar and Mataram University (Unram) Monitoring Center observes West Lombok regency.\n\n(Read also: Mangrove tourism abundant in Semarang)\n\nOut of the five monitoring centers, three (ITB, UGM and Unram) have been recognized by the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). The monitoring centers are organized within the Wonderful Indonesia Network of Sustainable Tourism Observatory (WINSTO), which is part of the International Network of Sustainable Tourism Observatory (INSTO).\n\nFrans Teguh said, “So far, the three [monitoring centers] have communicated and given updates and progressed on strategic issues implementation regarding sustainable tourism to the UNWTO in Madrid. The next step would be [to create] concrete programs and solutions from every party involved to increase the quality of the destinations, which have been observed by these monitoring centers.\n\n“This is an effort from the Tourism Ministry to push the development of sustainable tourism in Indonesia. The standards we have are global standards, and they adhere to the sustainable tourism principles of the UNWTO. The long-term development is supported ecologically and is feasible in terms of economy and fair in terms of social ethics to the community.

However, many of them want to get to know new cultures, in Europe and beyond and opt for long haul destinations.\n\nHolidays on the North or Baltic Seas, hiking in Bavaria or Austria, sunbathing on Mallorca or Crete. This is the way many Germans spend their holidays. But what are the most popular destinations worldwide?\n\nWith respect to Europe and the Mediterranean it is Spain, Italy, Turkey, Austria and Greece that are the most popular – in this order. For some travellers this is simply not enough and they are keen to travel much further for the ultimate experience.\n\nThe most visited long haul destinations for German tourists is the USA. In 2015, 2.27 million visitors from the Federal Republic arrived in the States. Last year it was a little less because of the strong dollar, though the official figures are not yet available.\n\n“USA is the undefeated number one among Germans,” says Torsten Schäfer, spokesman of the German Travel Association (DRV).\n\nThailand keeps the second place with about 840,000 visitors from Germany. The DRV, however, does not compare countries, but travel regions. The Caribbean is also among the top destinations. Cuba, Mexico and the Dominican Republic are all countries with over 200,000 annual visitors from Germany.\n\nAsia is highly popular among Germans. Indonesia, including Bali, welcomed 230,000 visitors from the country last year. China, without Hong Kong, had 650,000 German guests. However, there are uncertainties when it comes to visitors to this region. It is often not possible to distinguish between casual tourists or businessmen, since China is an important trading partner for Germany. This also applies to India, for example.\n\nIt is questionable whether the United Arab Emirates can be defined as a long haul destination. The DRV does not classify it as one. Dubai alone attracted around 460,000 Germans in 2016.\n\nSouth Africa has meanwhile registered a total record of 311,832 German tourists, according to South Africa Tourism.\n\nAccording to the DRV, the Maldives and Mauritius annually welcome 100,000 Germans each. Australia has a total of 200,000 visitors from Germany, while Brazil 250,000. In 2016, more than 5.5 million Germans booked a long-distance trip with German tour operators.

Mangroves have lot of benefits, as they maintain environmental balance and serve as a natural laboratory.\n\n\n\n"Therefore, let us continue to preserve these mangrove forests," Asrun said, adding that mangrove forests are also spread in numerous areas in the city of Kendari, in the villages of Tondonggeu, Sambuli, Purirano, Korumba, Lahundape, Anggoeya, and around the island of Bungkutoko.\n\n\n\nEspecially in Bungkutoko Island, the mangrove forests are being developed into mangrove trekking area for educational tourism by coordinating with the local communities.\n\n\n\nThis small island, located just at the mouth of Kendari Bay and off the coast of Kendari city, is surrounded by white sandy beaches and very dense mangrove forests with many different species of birds.\n\n\n\nWith its beautiful beaches, abundant native wildlife, and pristine waters, Bungkutoko Island has long been a favorite destination for visitors and local residents alike.\n\n\n\nOn the island of Bungkutoko, there are numerous pristine mangrove forests, where tourists enjoy trekking.\n\n\n\nTourists who come to this island will have the opportunity to explore the mangrove forest ecosystem, to fish, and to enjoy the variety of flora and fauna.\n\n\n\nIn addition to Bungkutoko Island, all the mangrove forests along the coast of Kendari will also be preserved, because they have a lot of benefits for humans and the environment.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, Kendari Regional Legislative Assembly (DPRD) member Heny Handayani Lantjita has called on the Kendari city administration to also involve investors, in addition to local communities, in managing the mangrove trekking area.\n\n\n\n"By involving investor in managing the Bungkutoko mangrove trekking area, the local revenue earned from the management of the region can be greater," she underlined.\n\n\n\nFurther, Heny added that by involving professional investors, the mangrove trekking area will become a favorite ecotourism destination on the island.\n\n\n\nShe highlighted that besides mangrove tourism, underwater tourism is also attracting visitors to the island of Bungkutoko.\n\n\n\n"Tourists who come to the island can also go surfing, diving, and snorkeling," she stated.\n\n\n\nShe noted that underwater ecosystems and mangrove forests around the island can be the mainstay attractions in Kendari, because Bungkutoko island ecosystem is relatively good compared to other small islands there.\n\n\n\nSpending just a day or two on the Bungkutoko Island will not be enough for visitors to enjoy the hospitality of the local community and their interesting culture and traditions, and to relish the beauty of nature at sunrise.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the natural panorama of the coast, the underwater world of Bungkutoko Island, with various types of coral reefs, species of fish and other marine biota, is extremely appealing.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the Kendari city government is making every effort to develop the 500-hectare island of Bungkutoko as a tourist attraction by promoting it through a variety of tourism activities aimed at domestic and foreign tourists.\n\n\n\nBesides Bungkutoko Island, tourist attractions that can be managed optimally to boost local revenue include Nambo beach and Bokori Island.\n\n\n\nBokori is one of the small islands with its scenic beauty, warm waters, and white sandy beaches.

These include exhibitions at the New York Times Travel Show, the Los Angeles Travel and Adventure Show, the Seatrade Cruise Global, IMEX America, DEMA Show and the Indonesia Sales Mission in USA. At these occasions Indonesia will promote itself as a great holiday destination. The government will also promote other areas than Bali in order to encourage US tourists to look beyond this famous island.\n\nIn 2017 the Indonesian government targets to welcome 15 million foreign tourists. Most foreign tourists who visit Indonesia originate from China, Malaysia, Singapore, and Europe.\n\nIn the World Economic Forum\'s Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2017 Indonesia ranks 42nd, climbing eight places compared to the previous edition, but trailing behind regional peers Singapore (13th), Malaysia (26th) and Thailand (34th). The World Economic Forum notes that Indonesia has made the most of its globally recognized natural resources and cultural resources at very affordable prices.\n\nThe Indonesian government has also prioritized the tourism and travel sector as an important driver of economic development, one that should cause the multiplier effect within the economy. Bambang Brodjonegoro, Head of Indonesia\'s Ministry of National Development Planning (Bappenas), said growth of the tourism sector should lead to rising foreign exchange earnings, more jobs for local workers, and more opportunities for the nation\'s small and mid-sized enterprises. The Indonesian government will invest about 9 percent of its budget in the tourism sector. Currently, the tourism sector represents about 6 percent of Indonesia\'s exports.\n\nThe World Economic Forum informs that Indonesia has further improved its international openness, becoming the country with the second strongest visa policy. Since 2015 Indonesia gave the visa-free facility to 169 countries. This policy aims at attracting more foreign tourists and thus earn more foreign exchange revenue even though it misses out on about IDR 1 trillion (USD $75 million) in revenues from tourist visas. However, Indonesia said it will review the policy and possibly scrap those nations that sent the fewest visitor to Indonesia.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum report, Indonesia also further expanded the offer and promotion of its natural resources by increasing the size of protected areas and attracting more online interest on natural activities. Still, better protection of the environment remains a key risk factor for the sustained development of the tourism sector in Indonesia. Being home of one of the most bio-diverse habitat in the world, Indonesia must address deforestation, insufficient treatment of waste-waters and augmenting species listed as threatened. Indonesia should also focus on improving its tourism (service) infrastructure; this involves improving the connectivity between regions but also the supply of hotel rooms, which is still low generally.\n\nShare this column\n\n‹ Back to News Columns'),

According to Skyscanner, Indian travellers don’t know when is the best time to book their travel. A survey by Skyscanner revealed that 72 per cent of Indian travellers do not know the best time to book travel for their holidays. While 31 per cent of respondents assume booking more than 12 weeks in advance, which is said to be the best time book flights. Additionally, 11 per cent feel that booking last minute is the key to getting a good deal. Skyscanner’s data analysis shows booking 24 weeks prior to departure is the ideal time to book tickets.\n\nBookings for Bali and Kuala Lumpur are best secured 25 weeks prior to departure, however Skyscanner notes that both destinations receive the most bookings two weeks prior to departure where flight prices witness a surge of 16 per cent and 11 per cent respectively, compared to the average fare from across India. Travellers with sights set on Europe can avail 17 per cent saving on fares to Amsterdam when they book 24 weeks in advance. For those who aren’t good planners, Budapest offers flexible weeks to travellers in terms of getting the optimum flight fares, where one can book 12, 20 or 23 weeks prior to departure and still save 13 per cent on the flight ticket. To explore Madrid without breaking the bank, Skyscanner recommends the best time to book is 15 weeks in advance.\n\nBTTB also indicated the best month to travel to 2017’s trending destinations which gives the most cost efficient fares. September and December are the best month to travel, overall. Although February is the ideal month to visit Amsterdam and Budapest as travellers can avail savings of eight per cent and nine per cent respectively, on tickets. Skyscanner recommended April for a visit to Bali, where they can save up to 10 per cent on flight prices, and September as the perfect month to book for Kuala Lumpur where travellers can save 18 per cent on average fares. A European favourite, Madrid will be best enjoyed in November where one can avail 17 per cent less than the average fare.\n\nSkyscanner noted that Madrid races ahead in terms of popularity with 164 per cent searches more than the average. Coming close on its heels is Budapest with 150 per cent searches in popularity followed by Amsterdam, Kuala Lumpur and Bali which receive 88 per cent, 55 per cent and 47 per cent searches in popularity.\n\nCommenting on the analysis, Reshmi Roy, growth manager, Skyscanner India said, “Knowing the best time to book flights is key to getting a good deal, so it’s surprising that nearly three quarters of Indian Travellers don’t know when the best time to book travel is and 69 per cent are way off in their estimations, guessing the best deals on flights can be found less than 12 weeks before departure. Furthermore, the majority of travellers are overspending by leaving booking until the last minute. ‘Best Time to Book’ solves this problem for travellers. After reviewing flight prices from the last two years, travellers can clearly see the savings they can make by booking at the right time and what to expect if they leave booking to the last minute.”'),

The area is known for having a considerable population of owls, which are slated to be the site’s main attraction.\n\nThe owl population was cultivated by the locals because farmers suffered crop failures due a widespread infestation of mice in Tanjung Raya, an area known for its chronic rodent problem. Crops would fail annually in the area, which would often lead to financial loss on behalf of the farmers. Today, the owls control the population of mice and thereby protect the crops.\n\nAsmardi, the pest observer and coordinator of the area’s Agam District, recently said that Nagari Koto Kaciak was suitable to become a hotspot for owl agritourism due to the sheer number of the special birds in the area. It’s said that there are more than 10,000 owls living in Nagari Koto Kaciak.\n\n“To make this plan come to reality, we need the support from the local government to allocate budget spending to increase the number of birdhouses for owls and other facilities,” said Mufridawati, the association’s head of climate change impact, as quoted by Bisnis.\n\nThe association hopes the plan will transform the area into a fresh travel destination for locals and foreigners alike due to its unique concept. If the scenario proves successful, it would stimulate the local economy and bring more prosperity to its people.\n\nMeanwhile, the West Sumatra Association and Protection Centre for Horticulture has donated several birdhouses for owls in the area since 2015. The association also provides training for local farmers who aim to do captive owl breeding.\n\nFurthermore, Nagari Koto Kaciak also has its own set of rules which regulate owl conservation in the area. Anyone who disturbs or hunts the birds will be sanctioned accordingly. Asmardi. added, “Thanks to the regulation, the safety of the owls here can be guaranteed.”\n\nIf the plan comes to fruition, this destination will serve as a new touch of Indonesian agritourism tourism that you’ll rarely find in the archipelago. For this reason, local, expat and foreign bird nerds should keep Nagari Koto Kaciak in mind.\n\nImage credits: Paul Morley, Harian Nasional'),

After arrival in Balikpapan by air (there are direct flights from Singapore), highlights of the trip include boat rides through mangrove forests, hikes in majestic triple-tier canopied jungle, waterfall discoveries, a canopy bridge walk, insights into the 2000-hectare Samboja Lestari rainforest rehabilitation project, and an inspection of the Sungai Wain protected forest, where the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation has successfully rehabilitated and released dozens of orangutans since the 1990s. Deforestation is a hot topic. The WWF reports that Kalimantan lost 29,000 km2 of lowland tropical forest – an area the size of Belgium – between 1985 and 2001 alone. The indigenous forests are still being rapidly cut for timber. The forests are replaced by palm oil plantations and fast-growing trees, mainly for the pulp industry. Massive forest fires in recent years have exacerbated ecological problems. However, there are glimmers of hope for both protection of the remaining forests and rehabilitation of the seemingly unusable ‘grass steppes’ that result from years of soil-depleting monoculture forestry. In the first two days of the tour, guests learn how the International Timber Corporation Indonesia (ITCI) is now a pioneer in sustainable agro-forestry. It is building alternative forest management projects that are much more sustainable than monoculture logging and burning. On the trip, guests sleep overnight in a lodge at the ITCI Basecamp, an hour and a half by boat and car from Balikpapan. From there they hike to protected parts of the forest, swim in waterfalls, and learn about the ecology of tropical rain forests and wildlife release plans. Visitors then move to the simple but charming Samboja Lodge, from where many nature trails radiate into the forest. It is here that sun bear and orang-utan rehabilitation takes place carried out by the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation. A percentage of the resort fee is invested in the forest restoration project. “Our Kalimantan tour has been created for people with an inquisitive mind who love forests and don’t mind simple accommodation,” says Herman Hoven, General Manager of Khiri Travel Indonesia. “The whole experience provides insights into the issue of massive deforestation on Kalimantan, while contributing to local efforts to help nature and wildlife conservation.” Khiri Travel says the Kalimantan trip combines easily with other Khiri tours in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. Prices for the Kalimantan trip start from US$300 per person on a twin-sharing basis, excluding air tickets.

The WWF reports that Kalimantan lost 29,000 km2 of lowland tropical forest – an area the size of Belgium – between 1985 and 2001 alone. The indigenous forests are still being rapidly cut for timber. The forests are replaced by palm oil plantations and fast-growing trees, mainly for the pulp industry. Massive forest fires in recent years have exacerbated ecological problems.\n\nHowever, there are glimmers of hope for both protection of the remaining forests and rehabilitation of the seemingly unusable ‘grass steppes’ that result from years of soil-depleting monoculture forestry.\n\nIn the first two days of the tour, guests learn how the International Timber Corporation Indonesia (ITCI) is now a pioneer in sustainable agro-forestry. It is building alternative forest management projects that are much more sustainable than monoculture logging and burning.\n\nOn the trip, guests sleep overnight in a lodge at the ITCI Basecamp, an hour and a half by boat and car from Balikpapan. From there they hike to protected parts of the forest, swim in waterfalls, and learn about the ecology of tropical rain forests and wildlife release plans.\n\nVisitors then move to the simple but charming Samboja Lodge, from where many nature trails radiate into the forest. It is here that sun bear and orang-utan rehabilitation takes place carried out by the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation. A percentage of the resort fee is invested in the forest restoration project.\n\n“Our Kalimantan tour has been created for people with an inquisitive mind who love forests and don’t mind simple accommodation,” says Herman Hoven, General Manager of Khiri Travel Indonesia. “The whole experience provides insights into the issue of massive deforestation on Kalimantan, while contributing to local efforts to help nature and wildlife conservation.”\n\nKhiri Travel says the Kalimantan trip combines easily with other Khiri tours in Indonesia and Southeast Asia.\n\nPrices for the Kalimantan trip start from US$300 per person on a twin-sharing basis, excluding air tickets.\n\nFor a full itinerary, which can be adapted for special interests, and a list of inclusions, contact Khiri Travel Indonesia.'),

He gave no more details of this transaction. Depending on the plans within the MOU, it seemingly marks a step forward in expanding the Southeast Asian maritime tourism market and in particular, the setting up of links between two countries in the region.\n\nMinister Arief emphasised that Indonesia is committed to develop its maritime tourism market and that this is supported by presidential decree. He summarised the previously mentioned actions of extending visa free entry to 169 nations and the changes made to the overhauled CIQP (Customs, Immigration, Quarantine, and Port Clearance) regulations which can now be online and approved within a few hours.\n\nDuring the presentation with Phuket Governor, Norraphat Plodthong, and stakeholders of Phuket\'s yachting industry, the key question was raised whether cross-border charters were possible whereby Phuket-based yachts can embark guests in Indonesia. The response was negative currently but Indroyono was quoted by the report saying: “We are working on this right now. I mean, the actual regulations are being drafted at this time.”\n\nHe added: “Please keep in mind that we are still learning how to do this, and we are learning from – and working closely with – the Thai Government to make this possible.” He also explained that he had arrived in Phuket after having a meeting with Thailand’s Tourism Minister, Kobkarn Wattanavrangkul.\n\nIndroyono reported that: “Minister Kobkarn has assigned a Permanent Secretary to work closely with us and to provide assistance to us in working with other Thai government departments to developing these regulations.” He called upon Phuket’s yachting sector to participate in the ‘Sail Sabang 2017’ being held in December.\n\nSail Sabang is due to be attended by Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, to open the competition.

The World Economic Forum notes that Indonesia has made the most of its globally recognized natural resources and cultural resources at very affordable prices.\n\nThe Indonesian government has also prioritized the tourism and travel sector as an important driver of economic development, one that should cause the multiplier effect within the economy. Bambang Brodjonegoro, Head of Indonesia\'s Ministry of National Development Planning (Bappenas), said growth of the tourism sector should lead to rising foreign exchange earnings, more jobs for local workers, and more opportunities for the nation\'s small and mid-sized enterprises. The Indonesian government will invest about 9 percent of its budget in the tourism sector. Currently, the tourism sector represents about 6 percent of Indonesia\'s exports.\n\nThe World Economic Forum informs that Indonesia has further improved its international openness, becoming the country with the second strongest visa policy. Since 2015 Indonesia gave the visa-free facility to 169 countries. This policy aims at attracting more foreign tourists and thus earn more foreign exchange revenue even though it misses out on about IDR 1 trillion (USD $75 million) in revenues from tourist visas. However, Indonesia said it will review the policy and possibly scrap those nations that sent the fewest visitor to Indonesia.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum report, Indonesia also further expanded the offer and promotion of its natural resources by increasing the size of protected areas and attracting more online interest on natural activities. Still, better protection of the environment remains a key risk factor for the sustained development of the tourism sector in Indonesia. Being home of one of the most bio-diverse habitat in the world, Indonesia must address deforestation, insufficient treatment of waste-waters and augmenting species listed as threatened. Indonesia should also focus on improving its tourism (service) infrastructure; this involves improving the connectivity between regions but also the supply of hotel rooms, which is still low generally.\n\nShare this column\n\n‹ Back to News Columns'),

It was (most likely) built by the Sailendra dynasty who were adherents of Mahayana Buddhism. Not much later, and not far away from the location of the Borobudur, the Sanjaya dynasty built the Prambanan temple complex around 850 AD (Prambanan is the other icon of Indonesia\'s pre-Islamic history). The Sanjaya dynasty adhered to Hinduism. Both historical sites are evidence that in the Hindu-Buddhist period (prior to the arrival and domination of Islam and Western forces), political power moved away from Sumatra (particularly Srivijaya) to Central Java.\n\nThe Borobudur is known as the world\'s largest Buddhist temple (built on a surface area of 2,500 square meters), decorated with 2,672 relief panels and 504 Buddha statues. The relief panels form a story (journey, or better: walking pilgrimage) that brings the visitor across three divisions that symbolize the three "realms" of Buddhist cosmology (with several stages of enlightenment), namely Kamadhatu (the world of desires), Rupadhatu (the world of forms), and lastly Arupadhatu (the formless world).\n\nRead more: Pre-Colonial Period of Indonesia\n\n\n\nAlthough last year the Heritage and Cultural Diplomacy (part of Indonesia\'s Ministry of Education and Culture) said it wants to limit the number of visitors that are allowed to enter the Borobudur temple (due to rising pressure on the structure of the ancient building), the central government mentioned the Borobudur temple as one of its ten priority tourist destinations, implying it wants to boost visitor numbers (significantly) to this site (see table below).\n\n10 Priority Tourist Destinations of the Indonesian Government:\n\nDestination Tourists\n\n2013 Tourist Target\n\n2019 Borobudur\n\nCentral Java 227,337 2,000,000 Mandalika\n\nLombok 125,307 1,000,000 Labuan Bajo\n\nFlores 54,147 500,000 Bromo-Tengger-Semeru\n\nEast Java 33,387 1,000,000 Thousands Islands\n\noff the coast of Jakarta 16,384 500,000 Toba Lake\n\nNorth Sumatra 10,680 1,000,000 Wakatobi\n\nSulawesi 3,315 500,000 Tanjung Lesu\n\nBanten 1,739 1,000,000 Morotai\n\nHalmahera, Maluku 500 500,000 Tanjung Kelayang\n\nBangka Belitung 451 500,000\n\nSource: Investor Daily\n\nNational Geographic\'s Iconic Adventure Tourism Sites Ranking (2017):\n\nSite Country Machu Picchu Peru Petra Jordan Borobudur Indonesia Acropolis Greece Great Wall China Sigiriya Sri Lanka Plitvice Lakes National Park Croatia Mammoth Cave National Park USA Provence lavender route France Avenue of Baobabs Madagascar\n\nSource: National Geographic\n\n\n\nShare this column\n\n‹ Back to Today\'s Headlines'),

But it was not to be under Akhilesh Yadav’s government which refused to allocate the land.\n\nAfter the political landscape changed in March, the Yogi Adityanath government released the 25-acre land on the banks of Saryu river, and the museum will now be built in collaboration between the central and UP state governments at a cost of Rs 225 crore. According to a concept note obtained by PTI, the main structure – to be located about six kilometres from the disputed Ram temple site – will be like a “grand temple” and will open into a “Ram darbar”. It will have cutting-edge technology such as virtual reality and 3D displays to showcase ancient traditions.\n\nThe concept note says the museum is for “devotees as well as tourists” and will depict the preachings of Lord Ram. The note was prepared by Ram Autar, who is the chairperson of the Ramayana Circuit National Committee formed by the Centre. A researcher in studies of Lord Ram, he describes him as “a historical figure and not a figment of one’s imagination,” though there is no academic evidence that Lord Ram existed beyond the pages of mythology and popular folklore based on Ramayana, one of India’s two epic poems.\n\nHis “teachings are not restricted to just Hindus. Lord ram has an all pervasive significance for people of all religions. The museum will reveal a lot of aspects of his teachings that science has not understood,” Autar told PTI. Autar and other proponents of the museum deny there is any political agenda behind the museum, although the museum is scheduled to be completed in 18 months, just before the 2019 general elections when the Ram Mandir issue is likely to figure in campaigning by the Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\n“As long as the reason behind building the museum is cultural, to promote Indian traditions, I have no problems,” said Harsh Kumar, a professor of ancient history at Allahabad University.\n\n“(But) if this is a political agenda, then I am afraid how they will represent Ram. I believe that Lord Ram is purely a mythical character and there is no proof of his existence in history. However, he has huge traditional and cultural resonance in India,” Kumar told PTI. The plan for the museum includes a “yagnashala” where yagnas will be performed every morning and evening to “purify” the environment and to make people understand the importance of such rituals in Hinduism.\n\nOn the walls of the court there will be murals and drawings of Lord Ram’s life journey. In another room, built almost like an amphitheatre, tourists will have the opportunity to sit and watch the life of the Hindu god being played out on projector screens with 3D visuals and audio. “The tourist will feel that Shri Ram is living his life in front of them,” the note said. It will draw inspiration from the Capital’s Akshardham Temple and the recently held exhibition of Sardar Patel at the National Science Centre.\n\nAutar, who also heads the Shri Ram Sanskritik Shodh Sansthan Nyas, has recommended a centre for science that will show tourists programmes on Lord Ram using augmented reality or virtual reality. The aim of this exercise, the note says, is to “connect the youth with their culture and religion”. In yet another room, there will be a big screen which will show films on Lord Ram, and these will be sourced from places such as Myanmar, Indonesia and Thailand, where Ramayana stories are popular. The plan also envisages a library and research centre for scholars.\n\nThere will be a separate enclosure where twice a day the teachings of Lord Ram will be preached by experts, scholars and others. The note also recommends a light and sound show depicting the places where Lord Ram visited which would be recreated on the museum premises. While Autar’s three-page note written in Hindi is now under consideration by the culture ministry, officials say they are awaiting more inputs from other experts, which will be added to the present draft.\n\n“We have started working with the state government to set up the museum and we are on track. We will finalise the details soon,” said Tourism and Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma, who visited the site just before the UP assembly elections.\n\n“However, let me reiterate that our efforts are not just towards building a museum, but about a holistic development of Ayodhya,” he said. Cultural activist Sohail Hashmi does not see any problem with a Ram Museum, but said that such a museum should include all interpretations of Lord Ram. “It should incorporate every tradition that includes Ram. It should not just be the north Indian upper class interpretation of Ram as the Hindu conqueror. Ram is very human, and he should be portrayed like that,” Hashmi told PTI.\n\n“Also, the museum should be built in collaboration with people who have worked on the mythology of Ram and not RSS pracharaks. It should be an inclusive museum with the entire debate on Ram being represented,” said Hashmi. The proposed cost of the museum is also raising eyebrows. At Rs 225 crore, it is higher than this year’s Rs 200 crore-budget for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pet scheme, Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, almost a five-time increase from last year.\n\n“I don’t think all of India’s museums put together would cost Rs 225 crore,” said Hashmi. RSS ideologue Rakesh Sinha was all for the museum. “Shri Ram represents our culture and tradition and his teachings are seeped in history. Even in other countries folktales about Shri Ram are popular. Why not promote him here? The western world calls our tradition pre-historic –why should we let them do that? This museum will showcase to the world our sabhyata (culture) and history,” said Sinha, honorary director, India Policy Foundation.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App'),

So, we have to dole out more money to take care of the relevant permits after docking at marinas," he said.\n\nRobbie Hearse, who participated in the Fremantle-Bali race, said all necessary services should be on standby 24 hours per day, as racers typically arrive on Bali\'s shores at different times.\n\n"There are those that finish [the race] in the morning, afternoon and evening, and even on different days [...] I cannot even leave Indonesia today, as quarantine services are closed," Hearse said on Sunday.\n\nOther foreign yachters have called on the government to establish more exit points for vessels planning to leave Indonesian waters.\n\n"Earlier, some friends and I wanted to depart for Labuan Bajo [Papua] to see Komodo Island [East Nusa Tenggara], but there were no exit points available," said Garth Curran, another race participant.\n\nTourism Minister Arief Yahya ordered ministry officials to better coordinate with relevant government agencies and institutions to address obstacles facing yachters arriving in Indonesia.\n\n"All marinas in the country should be capable of providing excellent services.

During their 12 days in the country they took in some of the main landmarks: trekking up the highest peak, the near 3,000-meter-high Mount Ramelau, followed by a bone-rattling motorcycle ride eastwards to Jaco, a tiny uninhabited island.\n\nWith secluded white sand beaches fronting turquoise seas and kaleidoscopic reefs — all offering lush diving — East Timor aims to triple annual visitor numbers to 200,000 by 2030, part of a plan to diversify an economy that depends oil and gas for almost all government revenue.\n\nIn 2014, East Timor’s tourism sector was worth a mere $14.6 million, but that will grow tenfold if a 2017 government blueprint is realized. “[The] government’s ambition is that overseas tourism revenue will reach US$150 million in real terms (in 2016 prices), and employment in the sector will reach 15,000,” the document explained.\n\nTimorese waters include what the Australian Institute of Marine Science describes as one of the world’s highest concentrations of dolphins and whales, while Conservation International estimates that the sea around Atauro, an island north of the capital Dili, is one of the world’s richest marine habitats.\n\nEast Timor mixes Pacific, Southeast Asian and Western influences, with local animist spirit houses sometimes only a short walk from Portuguese-built Catholic churches.\n\nEast Timor’s blend of nature and culture should enable it to capitalize on a global tourism boom. In 2002, when East Timor regained full independence, global tourists totaled over 698 million. By 2017, as Chinese and other Asian tourists numbers expanded, that number had nearly doubled to about 1.3 billion, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization.\n\nThe 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which East Timor has applied to join, received a combined 113 million tourists in 2017. Australia, which recently agreed to demarcate a sea boundary with East Timor, received over 9 million visitors in the year up to March 2018.\n\nBut as Kohn’s and Mietzle’s initial itinerary suggests, Southeast Asia’s second smallest country is usually overlooked by holidaymakers moving around the region.\n\nOf Bali’s 6 million visitors last year, just under 1.1 million of those arrivals were from Australia — a hint that East Timor is missing out on a potentially lucrative market given that Darwin is little more than an hour’s flight away.\n\nLast year, more than a million Australians flew past East Timor to reach Bali, while the first three quarters of 2017 saw only 9,438 Australian arrivals land at Dili’s Nicolau Lobato International Airport.\n\nChina is another potential source of visitors. More Chinese than Australians visited Bali last year and the UNWTO estimated that the amount spent worldwide on tourism by Chinese travelers was the highest of any nationality in 2017.\n\nEast Timor’s history may be undermining its tourism. A quarter century of violent subjugation by Indonesia up to 1999 resulted in an estimated 200,000 deaths. Intermittent bouts of instability since then mean that the country has not yet shed its strife-torn image, despite another recent round of peaceful and fair elections, the fifth since 2002.\n\nWhen Victoria McLadey told her friends in Australia of her plans to visit East Timor, she said the typical response was, “It’s dangerous, why are you going there?”\n\nThough that dicey reputation is dated, Timorese politics does affect tourism in other ways. On May 12, the country held its second parliamentary elections in less than a year, after a July 2017 vote produced a short-lived minority government.\n\nThat political stalemate meant no budget, and, with much of East Timor’s nascent economy contingent on state spending derived from oil and gas earnings, the impact was widely felt.\n\n“This year, business is down drastically since the government [was] not formed after the election. Many bookings [were] cancelled and not many people [are] coming,” said the manager of one of Dili’s plusher hotels.*\n\nAs far back as 1999, Xanana Gusmao, likely to become the country’s prime minister for a third time after his coalition won the elections, had pinpointed tourism as key to East Timor’s economic prospects.\n\nHowever, that year saw the Indonesian army and allied local militias loot and destroy much of the country’s buildings and public works as Jakarta wound up its occupation with a frenzy of violence, the legacy of which is still felt.\n\n“All public infrastructure, including roads, ports and airports, water and sanitation systems, and government facilities were either non-existent, destroyed or severely dilapidated,” the World Bank recalled in its March report on East Timor’s economy.\n\nAll the same, East Timor’s tragic history is something that could attract visitors — particularly to its stirring exhibitions and memorials in museums and at landmarks.\n\nMoreover, evidence from elsewhere suggests that politics and history may not cause lasting damage to a country’s tourism, with countries such as Thailand and Egypt seeing their tourism sectors ride out political instability and terrorism.\n\nPrice and accessibility are arguably bigger issues for East Timor’s tourism. Only three foreign airports serve Dili: Bali, Singapore and Darwin — a limited range of options that makes getting to East Timor expensive.\n\nReturn air fares for Bali-Dili flights during June and July stand at around $250, compared with $62 for Bali-Jakarta fares, and $175 for Bali-Singapore flights. Flying Darwin-Dili return around the same time will cost just under $528, slightly less than a return flight from Sydney to Bali, which is six times the distance from Darwin to Dili.\n\nWorse still, costs for travelers inside East Timor can be relatively high, a deterrent acknowledged by the government’s tourism plan. “Due to its remote location and the fact that its economy operates in United States dollars, Timor-Leste is relatively expensive [and] lacks the value for money proposition of many of its neighbors,” the document conceded.\n\n“As a cultural holiday it’s [East Timor] great, and the people are lovely,” said Victoria McLadey. “But it’s cheaper to get to Bali, it’s cheaper to stay there, [and] the food is cheaper.”\n\n*the hotel manager in question consented to an interview but requested after publication that his identity and affiliation be removed\n\nFollow us on Twitter Follow @Arevico'),

With Travel & Tourism forecast to rise by 4% a year for the foreseeable future, and 1.8 billion international travelers expected by 2030, the sector’s transformative power in terms of economic impact is clear. However, the resilience of this growth is dependent on the sector’s ability to recognize and respond to the internal and external challenges it faces.\n\nIn a world defined by rapid change and disruption, four external challenges emerged as being most critical to Travel & Tourism’s future:\n\nDemographic changes: Ian Goldin, Professor of Globalization and Development at the University of Oxford, identified three megatrends which will shape the future of Travel & Tourism. First the rapid decline in fertility which will mean that while the world population will stabilize in terms of numbers, it will be increasingly old. Secondly, the workforce is changing dramatically, driven in large part by immigration. And finally, the growth of emerging markets which continues to be much faster than older, developed, markets.\n\nTechnology: The challenges and opportunities of technological developments are extensive, but Ian Goldin focused on the moral and ethical impact of some of these advancements. Rob Rosenstein, CEO of Agoda, posed the more practical question of how the sector was preparing for the massive changes in distribution that technology will bring.\n\nClimate Change: Delegates were once again reminded of the potential impact of climate change. Ian Goldin emphasised that as yet there is no system in place to address the problems climate change will cause, while Keith Tuffley, Managing Partner & CEO of The B Team, highlighted that not acting on climate change will cost $44 trillion by 2060.\n\nChanging structures of work: Automation, freelance working, and the sharing economy are all impacting how people work and are employed. April Rinne summed it up with an anecdote from Robin Chase, co-founder of Zipcar, “My father worked in one job all his life, I will work in five, my child will work five at a time”. As a sector which directly employs 292 million people, Travel & Tourism will be at the coal face when it comes to providing quality jobs, flexible work, and defining new relationships with employees.\n\nAs well as these megatrends, some of the greatest challenges to Travel & Tourism come from its own success and growth. Speakers identified a number of ways the sector could prepare for the ‘1.8 billion’:\n\nUnderstand the demographics of this growth: The continued growth of the Chinese outbound market continues to represent a challenge when looking towards the future. Pansy Ho, Managing Director of Shun Tak Holdings Limited, suggested that the sector has not yet begun to anticipate the full extent of this. Amitabh Kant, CEO of NITI Aayog, echoed this view, reminding the audience that only a small percentage of Chinese and Indians have travelled abroad so far, and that as the rest of the population starts doing so it will change the global Travel & Tourism market.\n\nHarness technology for safe and secure travel facilitation: Ensuring secure travel is a key concern of the sector, as it always has been. However processing an ever-increasing number of travellers safely and securely, in a way which does not impinge too heavily on their time or convenience, is also a key challenge for the future. The concept of ‘digital borders’ was discussed, with the Tourism Secretary of Kenya, Said Athman, suggesting that a ‘global visa’ is not beyond the realms of possibility as the data and political will is there. Hyuk Lee, Regional Specialised Officer with INTERPOL, raised the opportunity of biometrics but suggested that agencies such as his did not know how to share information with the private sector. Catharina Eklof, Senior Vice President, Global Merchant Development, Mastercard, highlighted the importance of secure digital identity as a foundation for such a move.\n\nInvest in infrastructure: Investment in infrastructure was a key theme, particularly when looking at the ASEAN perspective. HE Arief Yahya, Minister of Tourism from Indonesia, highlighted the importance of foreign investment in the region, since government funding can only cover part of the investment that is required — in the case of Indonesia about 30% of the total requirement. This investment is needed across the board, not least in transportation. Talking from an aviation perspective, Arun Mishra, Regional Director of the Asia & Pacific Office of the International Civil Aviation Organization, emphasised specific concerns about infrastructure constraints, which he described as a main stumbling block for development in the region. Many airports are saturated and need a new runway ‘yesterday’. The problem reaches up into the skies themselves, with air navigation congested and urgent needs for new technology and navigation systems.\n\nAddress overcrowding in hotspot tourist destinations: One of the greatest challenges facing destinations, Christine Duffy, President of Carnival Cruises, emphasised that it is in everyone’s interest to address overcrowding as companies will not want to places where they will not have a good experience. Maria Damanaki, Global Managing Director for Oceans at The Nature Conservancy, and TP Singh, Deputy Regional Director, International Union for Conservation of Nature, highlighted the importance of impact on biodiversity and the environment which is also critical to the customer experience. Identifying ‘carrying capacity’ emerged as a potential solution which would allow both policy makers and industry to be on the same page. But, as Jamaica’s Minister of Tourism, HE Edmund Bartlett questioned, “How is carrying capacity measured and implemented?”\n\nAlex Dichter, Senior Partner at McKinsey & Company, emphasised that ultimately this is a solvable problem of management — there is enough space for everyone, it’s a matter of when and where they travel. It is an issue that needs to be addressed, and Travel & Tourism should be encouraged to take the initiative, considering that, unlike other problems, the sector has enormous power to do something about this one.\n\nDespite the myriad of challenges facing Travel & Tourism, there was optimism that they could be overcome. As Keith Tuffley pointed out — there is no sector better placed to inspire people, and contribute the new thinking and innovation that is required.\n\neTurboNews is a media partner for WTTC.'),

The country fears that this could lead to a drop in its foreign exchange earnings from tourism. Bali, the single largest tourist destination of Indonesia, has been receiving some 400,000 visitors via Qatar, of which 70% are tourists.\n\nThe anxiety is all the more heightened as a majority of these tourists originate in Europe and are ferried to Bali by Qatar Airways via Doha. According to Indonesian Tourism Development Dy Minister Igde Pitana, a threat looms large whether Qatar Airways will continue to bring tourists to Bali in the coming days. As of now Qatar Airways continues its operations to Bali ferrying tourists from\n\nEurope. Although there is a drop in tourist inflows, the impact is not significant as yet. Pitana was speaking to IPA on the sidelines of the Bali and Beyond Trade Fair (BBTF) at Denpasar, Bali, which concluded over the weekend.\n\nThe Qatar travel embargo has occurred at a time when Indonesia has put in place a new strategy for tourism development, which focuses on sustainable tourism aiming at the participation of local people in tourism so that everyone gets benefited by the growth in the industry. The new tourism strategy has three components, such as Great Spirit, Grand Strategy and Business Strategy. Pitana said every single tourist is important for Indonesia as the country’s economy is faced with challenges.\n\nThe Indonesian government lays the highest priority on tourism as this sector is expected to grow exponentially to become the single largest foreign exchange earner for the country. The snapping of air and land connectivity by Qatar’s neighbours also had an impact on the participation from Middle East in the business to business component of the trade fair. Out of the 264 buyers registered for the B2B segment, only 196 attended and the absentees were mostly from the Middle East. Still business worth $420 million (IDR 5.6 trillion) was transacted during the fair.\n\nSustainable tourism has a strong connection to the caring capacity of a destination. So, the Indonesian Tourism Ministry is promoting 10 new priority destinations beyond Bali. The minister clarified that these destinations were not meant to compete with Bali, but to keep Bali sustainable. “We are trying to make Bali a hub for Indonesia’s tourism and at the same time developing other destinations so the visitors can spread,” said Pitana.\n\nBali was still at the top of tourism point of interest in the travel expo, although buyers were also showing great interest in destinations beyond Bali, such as Toraja, Flores and Palembang. South Sumatra, a co-host of BBTF 2017, is one of the new destinations being promoted under the strategy. Other destinations in the sustainable tourism development plan include Tanjung Puting, Toraja and Wakatobi.\n\nPalembang, which will host the 2018 Asian Games, has rich tourism assets including an enticing nature, unique culture, and is known for its delicious cuisine. Palembang province is currently witnessing a massive infrastructure upgrade for the Asian Games. The improvements include development of the Musi River Edge Attraction, which is a tour package presenting 29 destinations along the banks of Musi River. The upcoming Asian Games is considered to be a great opportunity for South Sumatra to showcase its tourism potential to the world.\n\nBBTF is a B2B event that aims to advance the tourism industry through business sessions and the direct promotion of best practices in MICE and leisure tourism. Together with exhibitors and buyers from countries around the world, BBTF facilitates pre- scheduled appointments and business sessions for buyers and sellers to negotiate on their long-term leisure and corporate travel needs. Corporations, travel agents, hotel and resort chains, cruise operators, convention planners, venue operators and travel buyers leveraged the two and half days of business to business sessions to enhance their respective brands in the Indonesian and Asia Pacific markets.\n\nThe event provided great insights into how Indonesia is systematically promoting its tourism to include the sustainability aspect, which has a huge relevance to a country like India, which despite its huge tourism assets, approaches tourism development in a haphazard manner.'),

By July, we will probably have something built,” he says.\n\nHe visualizes a simple but captivating design for the 100-square meter gallery to be built on the property of Armando Cavalinda, a born-and-raised Boholano and prosecutor who volunteered to lend his land to the project. The initial art workshops are targeted to take place in the last week of June.\n\nInstead of capitalizing on the known skills of the Badjao, such as swimming, diving and dancing, Montano wishes to introduce art, beginning with paint as a medium. The art workshops will be spearheaded by Boholano painter Joey Labrador, who also suggests to create paint pigments from the region’s local soils and stones.\n\nMontano insists the project will be “turning ‘beggars’ into businessmen,” as the Badjao are known to dive, even in the deep parts of the water, for the measly coins thrown by tourists in the ocean. Their future artworks are seen to be sold initially for $5-10 a piece and that’s just the beginning—before this village slum gets a complete makeover with graffiti murals on its cemented walls.\n\nThe blueprint of Montano’s vision comes from neighboring Indonesia, where the slum community of Kampung Pelangi village has been transformed into a tourist hub. The town, which was solely revamped with donations and corporate sponsorships, is now known as Rainbow Village. The hub also has its own version in Thailand where the area of the country’s street art festival took place.\n\nWith its current internet fame, these Southeast Asian destinations’ vividly colorful exteriors attract domestic and foreign tourists alike—and Montano hopes for the same result. Its success is seen as a much-needed boost to a community’s local economy, but it could also jumpstart urban planning for Bohol’s lesser known villages as well.\n\nThe planned art gallery and exhibit has the potential to transform into a cultural hub altogether—fusing the rich roots of Badjao traditional dancing and singing, in turn delivering a culturally engaging tourist experience.\n\n“What is important is you introduce another window to them,” Montano says. “Painting is a universal language—they may be illustrating different things, and their favorite colors will be different from most, but it is universal,” he adds.\n\nThe TPB COO’s eyed project is completely passion-driven, with Montano being a painter himself. However, even without the aid of marketing and cultural research yet, the initiative, if successful, is capable of tapping Bohol’s local industries with the resources it needs—mining, wood, agriculture, services—in the long run.\n\nAnd that all begins with introducing art to a community that couldn’t access it otherwise. —CONTRIBUTED\n\nRead Next'),

Production-wise, the ad was good, but its originality was put in question because of its close resemblance to the tourism material that South Africa used in 2014.\n\nAfter initially defending the ad, the DOT admitted its “glaring similarities” to the South African material and so it canceled its advertising and marketing contract with McCann.\n\nIt’s back to square one for the DOT’s efforts to get close to the record of high tourist visits of neighbors Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\nIn the first place, was there really a need to terminate the “It’s more fun” campaign and replace it with a new one? Do tourism campaigns have to be changed whenever there is a change in administration?\n\nOther than saying that the former campaign failed to accomplish its objective, Teo did not present any market study or research data that would show that it was indeed a failure.\n\nTourism promotional campaigns do not have short gestation periods. They take time, often years, to gain traction in their intended market and be part of the bucket list of people who have the resources to see other places.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith almost all countries in the world competing for tourists, the efforts to draw them in have to be sustained and consistent. It’s no different from selling a product that other people are also selling.\n\nA classic example is Malaysia’s tourism promotion “Malaysia Truly Asia,” which was conceptualized by a Filipina, Julie Lingan. That slogan has been in use for over 10 years and continues to be the poster image of Malaysia’s successful tourism program.\n\nBut the more pressing question to ask is how McCann, a reputable international advertising firm, can commit such an egregious mistake of submitting to the DOT a rip-off from something it prepared for its former client, South Africa.\n\nDoes McCann not have an archive of past ad creations that its staff in the countries where it maintains offices can check with to find out if the materials they’re preparing are similar?\n\nIf it does not have that facility, surely it has access to Google and other search engines that can provide information about projects of the same nature by its own staff and other advertising companies.\n\nAccording to an advertising expert, the controversy that attended the “Sight” ad could have been avoided if it were categorized or treated as a local ad material.\n\nUnder existing industry rules, no local ad of that nature can be aired or released without prior certification from the Ad Standard Council that it complies with its standards or guidelines.\n\nHad the ad gone through the council’s review process, its clone-like resemblance to the South African material could have been discovered at the outset and the release of “Sights” disallowed.\n\nThe problem is, the ad was classified as a foreign or international material and therefore escaped the scrutiny of the council.\n\nWith the cancellation of DOT’s contract with McCann, the stage is now open for local advertising and marketing firms to show that they can do a better job in coming up with promotional campaigns that can increase tourist traffic to the country.\n\nRead Next'),

	(20170624, 'What you need to know about Malaysia\'s Tourism Tax', 'IDN', 7, -0.569395018, 'http://www.star2.com/travel/malaysia/2017/06/24/queries-new-tourism-tax-malaysia/', 'A new tax imposed on hotel guests is set to provide a sustainable fund for the country’s tourism industry. Photo: Filepic\n\nThe statistics on Tourism Malaysia’s website tell a reassuring story. Tourist receipts amounted to RM82.1bil last year, which is an 18.8% growth from RM69.1bil in 2015. Also, tourist arrivals last year stood at 26.76 million, a 4% increase from the previous year.\n\nA report by the World Tourism & Travel Council, meanwhile, forecasts the total contribution of travel and tourism to the country’s GDP to rise by 4.2% this year.\n\nThe Tourism Tax (TTx) – to be implemented on July 1 this year, instead of the previously reported Aug 1 – is set to provide a sustainable fund for the development of our tourism industry.\n\nTourism and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Nazri Aziz reportedly said potential revenue from the new tax would be around RM654mil, if an occupancy rate of 60% can be achieved for the 11 million “room nights” available in the country. A higher occupancy rate of 80% will boost collections to RM872.8mil.\n\nTTx, passed as part of the Tourism Tax Bill 2017, will see local and international tourists paying a levy to the operators of accommodation premises on a per-room, per-night basis.\n\nThe rates are RM20 for five-star accommodations, RM10 for four-star accommodations, RM5 for one- to three-star accommodations, and RM2.50 for non-rated accommodations, including budget hotels. It was recently reported, however, that the government may exempt the TTx on three-star hotels and below for locals.\n\nThe TTx will not apply to homestays, kampung stays, premises maintained by religious institutions for non-commercial purposes, premises operated by Federal and state government for non-commercial purposes, and premises with fewer than 10 rooms.\n\nHotels as ‘tax collectors’\n\nWhile the tax ultimately benefits the local tourism industry, it has put hotel operators in the position of “tax collectors”. At least, that’s how Malaysian Association of Hotels (MAH) president Sam Cheah Swee Hee views it.\n\n“The current model of the tourism tax unfairly places the burden of collecting the tax on registered hotels who are responsible for collecting and paying this to the government,” he said.\n\nHotel operators registered with the Tourism and Culture Ministry (Motac) are automatically included in the new tax’s scope. But Cheah pointed out that fewer than 15% of accommodation providers in Malaysia are registered with the ministry.\n\n“In terms of numbers, there are 3,126 accommodation providers that are registered with Motac. However, there are 9,578 accommodation providers listed on the hotel booking site Agoda.com and a further 11,698 accommodation providers listed on Airbnb,” he illustrated in a statement.\n\nData from MAH stated there are 6,452 unregistered hotel providers and a further 11,698 operators who provide accommodation through Airbnb.\n\nThe vast number of unregistered providers, Cheah reckoned, would require a significant amount of resources on the part of the Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMCD) to identify.\n\nPersuading unregistered operators to register is another challenge, said Malaysian Association of Hotel Owners president Tan Sri Teo Chiang Hong.\n\nThe high compliance requirement, according to him, will hinder unregistered operators from registering. This, he said, would continue to “encourage the gap that exists between those operating in the system and those outside of it”.\n\nA taxing issue\n\nTeo said recent years have seen most hotels in our country achieving 35% to 40% occupancy rate – well below the projected 60% mark suggested by the minister. TTx, he said, is likely to further push down the numbers.\n\n“It could encourage more tourists to book with unregistered and unlicensed hotels due to the lower costs,” he said, adding that a potential loophole exists whereby hotels can change their rating or operating model. Those actions would result in lower tax revenues for the government.\n\nMalaysia Budget Hotel Association president P.K. Leong said Motac held a meeting in Kelantan recently to inform industry players of the implementation of the tax. However, no proper discussion took place between both parties. Leong said there is no transparency regarding how the funds collected will be channelled back to the industry.\n\n“But since the money is collected by hotel operators, it should be used to improve the hospitality sector here,” he said.\n\nBased on the directive from RMCD, Leong also deduced that Airbnb operators will be exempted.\n\n“On average, those who operate Airbnb properties only have two rooms. Thus, they are able to enjoy exemption under the tax, which exempts accommodation with less than 10 rooms,” he said.\n\nIn an e-mail, Airbnb told Star2.com the company is having discussions with Malaysian authorities to “reach a fair agreement around the Tourism Tax”.\n\n“Airbnb wants to pay taxes, and we’ve partnered with governments in over 275 jurisdictions all over the world to make it easier for our hosts and guests to pay their fair share,” it said.\n\nAs of May 1 this year, the company has paid over US$240mil (RM1.02bil) in hotel and tourist taxes around the world.\n\n“We’re continuously working with governments and policymakers around the world to expand our programme and find a proper way to collect fair tax revenue from our host community – and Malaysia is no exception,” it said.\n\nSingle taxation system\n\nSome states have implemented their own tourism charges. These are the Heritage Tax in Melaka, Local Government Fee in Penang, Tourism Promotion Fee in Langkawi, and Local Government Fees/City Tax in Kota Baru, Kelantan.\n\nHowever, Nazri was reported as saying, on June 13, that the states would be asked to stop collection of their accommodation-based charges once TTx comes into effect.\n\nOn that note, Cheah said hoteliers don’t completely oppose TTx as the industry can benefit from a more sustainable fund. However, there are ways to make it less taxing for consumers.\n\n“Don’t charge per night, but impose a one-off payment instead. Also, don’t tax the locals,” he said, adding that an electronic system can be put in place to collect TTx from foreign tourists when they go through immigration.\n\nThat call to exempt locals from TTx is echoed by Malaysian Association of Tour and Travel Agents (Matta) inbound vice-president Datuk K.L. Tan.\n\n“Local Malaysian businesses and leisure travellers are already paying for GST and income taxes. Subjecting them to new taxes is of concern,” he said.\n\nAccording to Tan, the majority of domestic travellers travel for business and other purposes, such as family obligations, medical treatment, education and religious pursuits.\n\n“These are essential travellers and not tourists, in essence,” he said, adding that most locals don’t necessarily travel for pleasure as the definition of a “tourist” might suggest.\n\nTan said deferment is key to implementing TTx effectively and efficiently.\n\n“The tourism and hospitality industry has been given significant attention as it is known to be the dominant foreign exchange revenue earner and ‘saviour’ of the Malaysian economy.\n\nSustainable growth\n\nTan also said TTx would have some effect on the country’s tourism traffic. Tourists who are price sensitive, corporate and incentive groups as well as long-haul travellers who spend longer durations in the country may be put off by the tax.\n\nBut Tan reckoned short-stay tourists, like the ones from Asean countries and China, might not be put off by the per-night charge. He added that about 75% of tourists to Malaysia come from Singapore, Indonesia, China, Brunei and Thailand.\n\nHowever, he said that Malaysia’s tourism sector is trailing behind that of neighbouring Thailand and Singapore. Putting up more barriers may deter tourists from choosing Malaysia as a preferred destination.\n\nBut getting tourists in can be fixed by “making the right noise”, said Malaysia Inbound Tourism Association (Mita) president Uzaidi Udanis, referring to more aggressive promotional efforts.\n\nHowever, Uzaidi said greater promotional efforts through overseas events and media campaigns don’t come cheap.\n\n“Nobody likes taxes, but we need to be realistic about the current global economic situation. Our tourism industry needs a lot of promotion and incentive, both which can be provided with a more sustainable fund,” he offered, calling TTx a new model of co-operation between government and the private sector.\n\n“With greater funds, our industry will be able to enhance services and tourism infrastructures,” Uzaidi said, adding that all these improvements would be eventually reaped by tourists to the country.\n\nUzaidi said all countries have to come up with a more sustainable plan to further develop their tourism scene.\n\n“The tourism industry is very competitive. There’s no right or wrong timing. At this point, we have to be competitive to get tourists to visit,” he concluded.'),

In the event the visa is rejected, the full amount can be forfeited.\n\nThis hard-line approach by our federal government comes at a time when Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is talking-up the importance of the bilateral relationship, including tourism and business, trade, policing, and defence.\n\nTourism Australia has established an office in Jakarta, highlighting the huge potential of the Indonesian tourism market. And with only 100,516 – or 1.1% – of Indonesians who travel abroad coming to Australia last year, the upside is significant.\n\nMost officials also agree that the more Indonesians come to Australia, the more our respective citizens will get to know each other, and that is good for the bilateral relationship. So why this double standard of openly encouraging a broader and closer relationship with Indonesia, while maintaining excessive entry barriers for Indonesians to come here and spend money on hotels, cafes, taxis, and tourist sites?\n\nClearly, there is concern about maintaining border controls. Terrorism is an issue, just as the past movement of asylum seekers to Australia through Indonesia has been. But it is not clear why the fee is required for security and background checks that are routine to all incoming visitors. The economic contribution of tourists to the local economy offers ample coverage for the cost.\n\nMeanwhile, Indonesians are flying out to favoured destinations including Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, and Bangkok, as well as China, Japan, and South Korea, with India determined to join this list by next year.\n\nBut what about Australia? Australian statistics do show encouraging growth in the inbound market from Indonesia (up 15.4% in 2017), but this is from a very low base, and these figures include student and business travellers.\n\nIt is important, therefore, to compare the number of tourists coming to Australia from Indonesia in 2017 with their neighbours in Singapore and Malaysia:\n\nSingapore: 272,552 (population of 5.6 million)\n\nMalaysia: 257,504 (population of 31 million)\n\nIndonesia: 100,516 (population of 265 million)\n\n\n\nA new wave of tech-savvy and financially able Indonesians now seek out last-minute cheap airline tickets online for a long-weekend holiday in neighbouring countries. Australia misses out on this market as the visa process is too expensive, slow and bureaucratic, costing Australia potential tourism income and the citizens of both nations an opportunity to know each other better.\n\nDespite Indonesians having some the highest visa compliance rates of any tourists, Australia still seems determined to discourage them from coming here for a holiday.\n\nIt is interesting to note that when Indonesia removed the Visa on Arrival fee applied to all Australians heading to Bali, it came at an annual cost of $50 million to the Indonesian government. The following year (2016) saw the number of Australians holidaying in Bali increase by more than 16%, adding $145 million to the local economy. This is a good indication of what Australia could achieve by reducing barriers and encouraging more Indonesians to holiday in the country.\n\nAustralians often perceive Indonesia negatively, with a high degree of misunderstanding and suspicion, yet the country is increasingly more important to Australia than Australia is to Indonesia. Therefore, the sooner everyday Australians, particularly young people, are brought into closer contact with Indonesians, the sooner Australians will understand that Indonesia is not a threat, and in fact can contribute significantly to local economic growth.\n\nPerhaps a good starting point in sending a more consistent and neighbourly message would be to introduce a far cheaper and simpler visa process for Indonesian tourists wanting to visit; just like the 1.1 million Australians who holiday in Bali every year enjoy.\n\nRoss Taylor'),

In the case of New Zealand, family reunions feature largely in the figures. That makes Indonesia our number one leisure destination since 2010 when it leapfrogged the USA.\n\nSee Also Bali travel guide\n\nSee also: 20 things that will shock first-time visitors to Bali\n\nBali is the pull factor. Compared with the number of Australian residents heading for Bali, the number who visit other parts of Indonesia pales.\n\nEven the Bali bombing of October 2002, which took the lives of 88 Australians, proved only a temporary blip in our long love affair with the Island of the Gods. In November 2002, the month following the bombings, arrivals from Australia shrank by over 50 per cent from the 16,100 who travelled to Bali in November the previous year. By November 2003, a year after the bombing, the figure had swollen to 24,200, a 50 per cent increase over the figure for November 2001.\n\nBy these numbers alone we show our affection. People fall in love with Bali. The sound of trickling water in the rice terraces, the mossy temples, the tok-tok noise of bird scarers turning in the wind, the spirit houses in the rice fields with their faded, flapping shreds of yellow cloth, the soaring bamboo penjors that arch above the roadsides, the smell of kretek cigarettes, the banyan trees wrapped in chequerboard cloth, the women heading off to their midday prayers with a pyramid of fruit and flowers piled on their heads, the sound of a gamelan orchestra drifting through a silky night –Bali casts a spell, yet there are plenty who are not enchanted.\n\nOut of 42 comments posted in response to an article on Bali published on the traveller.com.au website in 2015, some were stridently negative.\n\n"The great thing about all the Aussies travelling to Bali is that there are less idiots in Australia. Bali, no thanks."\n\n"I went once and that was more than enough for me."\n\nAdvertisement\n\n"There is no way I will ever go to a place called Bali."\n\n"I\'ve never encountered vendors that aggressive"\n\n"Why would anyone spend money to go to an island full of bogan Australians? I just don\'t understand the appeal."\n\n"Filthy beaches and streets, constant harrasment (sic) by vendors, horrible place. Only good thing is that it is full of the bogans that would otherwise be spoiling other places!"\n\nThese are fairly typical responses to any travel article on Bali. Are they seeing the same place as those who sing its praises? Possibly not. If their only experience of Bali is the deplorable mess of Kuta, it\'s no wonder they\'re less than enraptured.\n\nArrests, drug convictions and assaults involving Australians in Bali provide never-ending fodder for some media, and they don\'t have to look far to find raw material. What looks like a tolerant culture to some visitors who fail to comprehend a set of social norms outside their own can be taken as a licence to unleash their inner (80s) Robert Downey Jr, resulting in some spectacular life crashes.\n\nTo the Indonesian government Bali\'s tourism industry is a cash cow that keeps on giving, a huge employment machine and an important source of foreign exchange. Keen to spread the world\'s love for Bali more evenly within their archipelago, the Indonesian government has an ambitious program to develop 10 new versions of Bali. The list includes the 9th century Buddhist temple at Borobudur in Central Java, Lake Toba in North Sumatra, which the government hopes to turn into the "Monaco of Asia", Bali\'s neighbouring island of Lombok and Labuan Bajo, a former fishing village at the western end of the island of Flores.\n\nIt\'s a tough call. Bali\'s Hindu religion, landscape, architecture and affection for flowers, large-scale religious ceremonies and daily rituals make it a bright star, unique within the Indonesian universe and one that will be hard to replicate.

Rangers need to rearrange the routes that were cut off by quake-triggered landslides, and are also evaluating any shaky ground that could be dangerous for trekkers, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the national disaster mitigation agency.\n\n"The area is still experiencing aftershocks which could trigger more landslides, although the intensity continues to weaken, So far there have been 346 aftershocks recorded since the initial earthquake," Nugroho said.\n\nA total of 1,226 trekkers, including 696 foreigners from 27 countries -- Thailand accounted for more than 300 of them -- were hiking up the mountain when the earthquake struck. An Indonesian hiker from Makassar in Southeast Sulawesi died on the mountain in a landslide, while a Malaysian hiker who had already descended died after she was struck by falling debris in the house she was staying in.\n\nThe Malaysian woman was one of 17 people who died as a result of the quake, while about 160 were treated in local hospitals for injuries.\n\nEarthquake survivor Ridwan Wahyudi sits with his family inside a shelter in Sambelia village on Lombok.\n\nBut how safe is it now for tourists to come to Lombok? The island just east of world-renowned Bali is a popular tourist destination in its own right. The 3,726-metre Mount Rinjani, which is the country\'s second highest peak, is one of the main attractions in addition to the island\'s pristine, pinkish-white sandy beaches.\n\n"Tourism on the island is not affected by the earthquake," said Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, the coordinating minister of maritime affairs, whose portfolio includes tourism.\n\nTaufan Rahmadi, a local tourism activist, acknowledged that news about the earthquake could discourage foreign visitors but he advised those wishing to come to Lombok to closely look at the map.\n\n"The worst-hit areas are East Lombok and North Lombok districts which lie around the foot of Mount Rinjani, while other areas are safe and life on the island is back to normal," he told Asia Focus.\n\nQuick response by rescuers and disaster mitigation agency officials to aid those affected is always of paramount importance after a calamity such as an earthquake. But so too is the quick dissemination of information on which areas are affected and which are not, said Rahmadi, who is a member of the Indonesian Tourism Development Corporation and is in charge of Mandalika, a designated tourism spot in southern Lombok.\n\nMandalika is one of the 10 main tourism destinations across the country that the government is developing in a bid to attract more foreign tourist arrivals. The groundbreaking for development of the 1,175-hectare tourism area was held in 2011 by then-president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.\n\n"We have attracted US$500 million worth of investment in Mandalika. The infrastructure there is ready. A resort chain with 400 rooms is under construction there and is set to finish this year, while another one has just started," Pandjaitan said during a media briefing last Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the central statistics agency, foreign tourist arrivals to Indonesia in June totalled 1.32 million, an increase of 6.1% from May and 15.2% from the same month last year. Four out of the top five visitor sources were neighbouring countries: Malaysia, Singapore, Timor Leste and Australia.\n\nIndonesia welcomed 7.53 million foreign tourists from January to June, an increase of 13.1% from the same period last year. The momentum is expected to continue given that the country is the site of two major international events: the Asian Games this month and the IMF-World Bank annual meeting in October.\n\nPandjaitan said the government expected to welcome 20 million foreign tourist arrivals next year and the tourism sector was expected to generate at least $7.5 billion in revenue to the state budget.'),

By 2016, it was already recording 6,000 annual visitors — as many as 50 or more per day — despite the seven-hour drive and three-hour hike required to reach it from the nearest town.\n\nAs its popularity as a destination grows, there are concerns that the community’s traditions and way of life could be sacrificed in the process.\n\nLocals interviewed for this story expressed a general satisfaction with the economic stability that tourism revenue has brought. The one recurring complaint was about the quality of the interactions between visitors and residents.\n\nReaching the village of Wae Rebo on Indonesia’s Flores Island requires a seven-hour drive down rugged jungle roads from the port town of Labuan Bajo. At the edge of the village of Kombo, motorcycle taxis whiz tourists to a trailhead, where they hike three hours up a mountain. Passing stunning views of the jungle valley and the ocean and leading travelers over a bamboo bridge, the trail meanders through a forest interspersed with ripening coffee trees. Finally, it gives way to a stunning sight: the village of Wae Rebo. Nestled into a mountain valley 1,100 meters (3,600 feet) above sea level, its seven conical houses are tipped with mist from passing clouds.\n\nWhile the journey may sound challenging, it doesn’t dissuade an average of 50 tourists from making it every day. Arriving anywhere from the late morning until the late evening, visitors from all over the world sleep on simple woven mats in the five-story-tall cone-shaped “drum houses,” called mbaru niangin the Tombo Manggarai language. They are free to explore the village grounds and chat with locals before sitting down to a traditional dinner, all for the equivalent of about $24 a night.\n\nThe village of 1,200 inhabitants began its dalliance with ecotourism in 2007 and by 2016 it was already recording 6,000 annual visitors. The rapid tourism growth is almost as spectacular as the locals’ apparent acceptance of it, considering that the first recorded outsider to visit came just three decades ago, in 1984. As its popularity as a destination grows, there are concerns that the community’s traditions and way of life could be sacrificed in the process, as can happen when an influx of tourists enters a small community.\n\nThe International Ecotourism Society defines ecotourism as “Responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and improves the well-being of local people.” Ecotourism offers an alternative to mass tourism that can help locals prosper financially while fostering intercultural exchange. Tourism is a major industry in Indonesia; the island of Bali, for example, hosted more than 5 million tourists last year. Based on Bali’s success, in 2017 President Joko Widodo presented a “10 New Balis” plan to increase tourism around the country. The main town on Flores Island, Labuan Bajo, is among the 10 sites, meaning tourism to Wae Rebo, its closest ecotourism village, will likely continue to increase.\n\nEcotourism can allow communities to generate income without relying on natural resource extraction, which can harm the environment if overdone. In Wae Rebo, agriculture and ecotourism work side by side. Residents of the village have traditionally relied on coffee production as a primary source of income. They harvest and process the crop, before carrying it on their backs down the mountain to nearby markets. But with unpredictable weather in recent years, the harvest wasn’t enough to keep the community afloat. In the early 2000s, Martin Anggu, a Manggarai local who now runs a guesthouse in the nearby village of Denge, approached Indonesian ecotourism NGO Indecon with the idea of patching up Wae Rebo’s two ailing drum houses and building five new ones, introducing ecotourism in the process.\n\n“He told me the community was quite frustrated with the economic situation because their agriculture isn’t really enough to support them,” Indecon’s Ary S. Suhandi, who has worked with the village from the outset, told Mongabay.\n\nA series of high-level meetings followed in Jakarta, and eventually Jakarta-based architect Yori Antar took on the building component of the project. With input from locals, his team built five new drum houses with funding from private donors, including French water company Danone. In 2012, the village received a UNESCO Cultural Heritage award, further putting it on the map.\n\nTourists and locals chat.

Image by Sarah Hucal for Mongabay.\n\nIndecon, which had already helped nine other villages in Flores introduce ecotourism, guided the villagers through the process at the beginning and offered counsel when they requested it. The mountain path was made more accessible, Indecon offered tourism-management lessons, and the villagers set up working groups to cook meals for tourists, maintain the grounds, and continue with agricultural activities.\n\n“We never wanted tourism to take [the] place of agriculture; they have to go hand in hand,” said Suhandi. His team also focused on a slow tourism growth model for Wae Rebo: “We realize that if business is too booming, it will backfire for the culture.” Today, Indecon advises on ecotourism operations and a small council of Wae Rebo residents controls the revenue from tourism, as they have done from the beginning.\n\nThat the village was groomed for ecotourism does not seem to bother many of the inhabitants, including Kassius Manie, a 26-year-old from Wae Rebo who is one of several people responsible for managing tourists.\n\n“The old houses were not good enough to live in and rebuilding them is so expensive, so we were lucky when some organizations and Indonesian architects came here and said ‘this is perfect for ecotourism,’” he told Mongabay. “We needed some help from people and at that time, people came to help us. It’s a lucky place.”\n\nThe drum houses are undeniably unique. Made of palm thatch, the 15-meter-high (50-foot) buildings are each home to six to eight families who live side by side, as they have done for centuries, in small adjacent rooms separated by curtains for privacy. Families share the large hearth built into the center of the floor, and sacred drums hang above it — the medium to communicate with the ancestral spirits. Each house has five floors, each with a specific purpose. The second floor, for instance, is used to store food and supplies, and the fifth is reserved for offerings to the spirits. Two houses in the village have been designated specifically for tourists.\n\nDuring an early Sunday afternoon visit, the village was unusually quiet. Many of the residents live between Wae Rebo and its sister village of Kombo at the base of the mountain, where schools and other facilities are located. On this particular day, there was a school celebration and most people had traveled down to attend it.\n\nSitting under the scorching sun in a traditional Manggarai sarong paired with a faded red T-shirt, middle-aged villager Lodovikus Damput said tourism had benefitted Wae Rebo. “It’s had so many positive effects on the community. We used to have simple wooden homes before and now we have only a few houses that are not in very good condition,” said Damput. Villagers who do not live in the drum houses reside in basic homes financed by ecotourism revenue.\n\nThe money generated from tourism means the community can rely less on government support and send their children to school, added Damput’s friend, Kobus Lori Bai.\n\nIn addition to the fee for a one-night stay, tourists also contribute a small symbolic amount — $1 or $2 — during the welcome ceremony given by “Papa” Alex, the 90-year-old village chief, who gives a prayer to the spirits of the ancestors when each visitor arrives. All the revenue goes into the fund managed by community members, who put it toward maintaining the houses and grounds, funding children’s education through university, building new houses in Kombo and maintaining a pension for the elderly.\n\n“I have two children at university, so I’m very happy the foundation can support them or help build roads, for example” Lori Bai said. “It’s possible now.” Notably, neither man appeared to be at all annoyed by having their photos taken — in fact, they seemed to enjoy it.\n\nThe relaxed afternoon is rare for Damput, Lori Bai and their families. Like most residents, they harvest coffee daily. Coffee production remains each family’s main source of income, although locals also farm other crops like cinnamon and yams. “The last two years were very bad for coffee production because of the climate,” said Lori Bai. “But at the same time, we were lucky enough to have cinnamon.”\n\nBoth men spoke at length about the help they received in improving their coffee production methods and the quality of their beans, another benefit of the ecotourism project organized with Indecon. Thanks to attention placed on Wae Rebo through ecotourism, a group of coffee distributors from West Java now purchases beans directly from the village. Tourists can purchase beans from the families during their stay.\n\nIf Wae Rebo residents expressed one recurring complaint about the influx of tourists it was about the quality of the interactions between visitors and residents. Damput and Lori Bai said they wished tourists would take more time to talk to them and learn about the village, not simply snap selfies. Working occasionally as porters, Lori Bai and Damput see the value of tourist guides who can explain the local rules and customs to visitors. Moments earlier, they watched as a small group of tourists walked up a hill and right onto a poorly marked sacred burial site they likely had no idea was off-limits. Lori Bai looked on, solemnly.\n\nAs the day continued, the tranquil atmosphere was replaced with an air of chaos as a steady stream of tourists trickled in. By early evening, the lawn was covered with selfie stick-wielding visitors. A Chinese guest launched a compact drone while a group from Jakarta posed with the Indonesian flag on the steps of a drum house. Many doled out candy to the local children, who began to swarm around them impatiently, their little hands outstretched. Others asked to take a picture with Papa Alex, a request he seemed genuinely happy to grant. Around dusk, a rousing game of volleyball began, played by an evenly mixed group of tourists and locals. Yet even amid the carnival-like atmosphere, the villagers this reporter spoke to expressed little discontent.\n\n“A lot has changed since tourists started to come to the village,” said Vilomina Ursula, a young mother who took a break from weaving a midnight-blue songketsarong in the shade of one of the drum houses to chat. “We can send our children to school and we also have a lot to do, like cooking for the guests, working with coffee and weaving,” she said. In April, she had joined a working group to make crispy taro chips with honey and chili for sale to tourists.\n\nYet, as a mother, she expressed concern about the way guests interacted with her children. “We are worried so much about the kids when they play with tourists. Some tourists spin the kids around by their arms and by night they feel sick and have to go to the shaman to have a special treatment,” she said. It was certainly alarming to see the ways in which some tourists threw the children into the air or picked them up as if they were their own.\n\nUrsula said she wished tourists would give candy for the children to the village’s adults, who could then determine when the kids received it. “When tourists give candies, the children come with a huge group and they can have aggressive behavior, tugging on the tourist’s clothes,” she said. “We want children to collect rubbish and receive a candy reward, for example.”\n\nMarcela Arita Sual belongs to one of the rotating cooking groups of nine people who prepare food for tourists. It’s a paid job, supported by tourism income, and one she is happy to have. She also weaves sarongs, a side business that has been booming since the tourists arrived.\n\nYet she shares Ursula’s concerns about strangers playing with her children and giving them candy, describing the situation as “out of control.”\n\n“There should be more information for the tourists so they know how we locals feel,” she said.\n\nLater that evening, her cooking group seemed unprepared to feed the 107 people who had arrived at the village that day. A group of 20 Vietnamese tourists arrived close to 9 p.m. as dinner was being cleared away, presenting a challenge for the cooking crew. The town lacks phone and internet connections, so there is no reservation system and no way to predict how many people will arrive each day. Latecomers pose a problem.\n\n“What happened last night was beyond our expectations and we had to do the best we could,” said another member of the cooking group, Meri Emiliana Luhur, the next morning. Luhur, however, feels the number of tourists should not be limited. “We are OK with many people; they just need to arrive earlier,” she said.\n\nManie, the 26-year old local, sitting cross-legged next to the women in the cooking area, agreed that there was a disconnect when it came to informing tourists about how to behave in the village; ecotourism is still largely a process of trial and error for the villagers. “We are still building the system,” he said.\n\n“We have an orientation [program] when people arrive, but it’s difficult if people cannot speak English or Indonesian,” he said, adding “there are always misunderstandings.” He said the village was considering adding a satellite dish to support a reservation system.\n\nWhen it comes to preserving their culture, for Manie there is no choice: “Many of us are very open; it makes our culture strong. We say, the people come here because of the culture, so we must keep it, because if the culture is gone, the houses are also gone.”\n\nManie said he felt strongly that Wae Rebo’s ecotourism should continue to be led by its inhabitants. “If someone came from outside, they might try to change things” he said. And anyway, he added, “now it’s up to the younger generation to preserve our culture.”\n\nBanner image: A tourist from Jakarta poses with the Indonesian flag.Image by Sarah Hucal for Mongabay.\n\nCorrection 8/20/18: This story was updated to describe Labuan Bajo as a town, not a city.\n\nFEEDBACK: Use this form to send a message to the editor of this post.

His team also focused on a slow tourism growth model for Wae Rebo: “We realise that if business is too booming, it will backfire for the culture.” Today, Indecon advises on ecotourism operations and a small council of Wae Rebo residents controls the revenue from tourism, as they have done from the beginning.\n\nThat the village was groomed for ecotourism does not seem to bother many of the inhabitants, including Kassius Manie, a 26-year-old from Wae Rebo who is one of several people responsible for managing tourists.\n\n“The old houses were not good enough to live in and rebuilding them is so expensive, so we were lucky when some organizations and Indonesian architects came here and said ‘this is perfect for ecotourism,’” he told Mongabay. “We needed some help from people and at that time, people came to help us. It’s a lucky place.”\n\nThe drum houses are undeniably unique. Made of palm thatch, the 15-meter-high (50-foot) buildings are each home to six to eight families who live side by side, as they have done for centuries, in small adjacent rooms separated by curtains for privacy.\n\nFamilies share the large hearth built into the centre of the floor, and sacred drums hang above it—the medium to communicate with the ancestral spirits. Each house has five floors, each with a specific purpose. The second floor, for instance, is used to store food and supplies, and the fifth is reserved for offerings to the spirits. Two houses in the village have been designated specifically for tourists.\n\nDuring an early Sunday afternoon visit, the village was unusually quiet. Many of the residents live between Wae Rebo and its sister village of Kombo at the base of the mountain, where schools and other facilities are located. On this particular day, there was a school celebration and most people had travelled down to attend it.\n\nSitting under the scorching sun in a traditional Manggarai sarong paired with a faded red T-shirt, middle-aged villager Lodovikus Damput said tourism had benefitted Wae Rebo. “It’s had so many positive effects on the community. We used to have simple wooden homes before and now we have only a few houses that are not in very good condition,” said Damput. Villagers who do not live in the drum houses reside in basic homes financed by ecotourism revenue.\n\nThe money generated from tourism means the community can rely less on government support and send their children to school, added Damput’s friend, Kobus Lori Bai.\n\nIn addition to the fee for a one-night stay, tourists also contribute a small symbolic amount—$1 or $2—during the welcome ceremony given by “Papa” Alex, the 90-year-old village chief, who gives a prayer to the spirits of the ancestors when each visitor arrives. All the revenue goes into the fund managed by community members, who put it toward maintaining the houses and grounds, funding children’s education through university, building new houses in Kombo and maintaining a pension for the elderly.\n\nThis story was published with permission from Mongabay.com.

It was one of three major quakes to rock the island in less than two weeks, producing more than 350 aftershocks and flattening large portions of the island.\n\nNeighboring Bali, the most popular destination in Indonesia and one of the places in Asia most visited by tourists, saw at least two deaths due to the earthquake on Sunday. But it is unlikely to see any considerable damage to its tourism industry.

Britain and Australia are among numerous embassies that have already issued “do not travel” warnings for Lombok.\n\nAlready grappling with a difficult search and rescue effort after Sunday’s disaster, humanitarian assistance to the people of Lombok was further complicated when yet another strong quake hit the north at lunchtime on Thursday.

Most are still living in refugee camps,” he said. “The community is traumatized.” The International Red Cross says an estimated 600,000 people have been affected.\n\nIndonesia is highly disaster prone, partly because it sits on the so-called "Pacific Ring of Fire," a string of volcanos where some 90 percent of the world’s earthquakes occur. A tsunami in 2004 devastated parts of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and killed more than 160,000 people, while a violent eruption of Mount Merapi near the Javanese city of Jogjakarta in 2010 saw hundreds killed and almost 400,000 evacuated.\n\nAccording to Mari Elka Pangestu, Indonesia’s former tourism minister and an economics lecturer at the University of Indonesia, the impact on tourism from the latest earthquakes will be confined only to Lombok. “Lombok is part of Indonesia but the rest of Indonesia is fine.

There are other parts of Lombok as you do this recovery that will still be okay.”\n\nWhile there was some superficial damage to the inside of Lombok and Bali’s respective airports, no damage was done to the runway, meaning there have been no disturbances to flights. From Monday to Thursday, Lombok International Airport operated 24 hours a day to facilitate additional flights off the island and rescuers arriving with supplies.\n\nDespite the ongoing threat of Bali’s Mount Agung erupting throughout 2017 and into early 2018, Indonesia still saw more than 14 million tourist arrivals last year according to the nation’s Central Statistics Agency – some 3.5 million more than the prior year.\n\nNevertheless, the Lombok disaster will be a major blow to the Indonesian government’s vision to develop the tourism sector. Lombok was last year identified as one of the “10 new Balis” in President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo’s strategy to encourage tourists to venture beyond Bali along with Lake Toba in Sumatra and Labuan Bajo near the Komodo National Park.

"We only offer to any potential foreign investor a project with a return like 13 per cent," he said. He said at the end of the roadshow the two countries agreed to promote tourism in Labuan Bajo, a tourist town in Flores that is near Komodo and Rinka islands, the home of the famous Komodo dragons.

The Indonesian government has flagged that investment along with household consumption will be the key drivers of GDP growth next year.

This was due to factors such as limitations on foreign investment, including investment caps, limitations on expat work visas, shortages of skilled local staff and low levels of labour productivity. "Firms also incur large indirect costs due to poor logistics, infrastructure gaps, labour skills shortages and complex business licensing requirements," the submission said. The DFAT submission said in 2015 Indonesia ranked 23rd as a destination for Australian outward investment. Mr Bambang said his general impression was that Australia didn\'t know Indonesia very well, with one roadshow attendee expressing surprise at the size of its population.\n\n"After our discussions with both super funds and the Future Fund during the roadshow we know they have been investing all over the world," Mr Bambang said. "To my surprise, they have invested for example in Mexico, which is so far away. We are both G20, we are emerging economies but no single dollar in terms of Australian long-term funds is invested in infrastructure in Indonesia but in Mexico they have done so." Uncertainty issues REST Industry Super said it currently had no direct investments in Indonesia due to "the risk-return profile being less competitive than other opportunities globally".\n\n\n\nSuper fund Hostplus said 35 per cent of the more than $2.7 billion it invested in infrastructure was offshore - mainly in the US and UK but also New Zealand, France, Austria, Germany, Poland and Mexico.

Reuters\n\nThe Southeast Asian region is home to major labour-sending countries – Indonesia, the Philippines, Myanmar – as well as labour-receiving countries – Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei – which also receive large numbers of labour migrants from Nepal, Bangladesh and India.\n\nIn Malaysia, about one in four employed persons are migrants. In Singapore, foreigners account for about 40 percent of the island’s total workforce (2012), while in Thailand (2010), there were 2.46 million low-skilled migrants from three neighbouring countries, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia.\n\nHost countries benefit from the enhanced economic growth that migrant labour makes possible, which may entail winners as well as losers, while migrants benefit from employment and livelihood opportunities, to the extent that decent working and living conditions are ensured for migrant as well as local workers.\n\nThe social dimension of Asean’s regional integration, however, seems to have taken a back seat to trade liberalisation and regional economic integration, judging by the glacial pace of progress towards a mandate (and instrument) for the enforcement of the Asean Declaration on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers (2007).\n\nIn the Southeast Asian region, citizens of Malaysia and Singapore have long benefited from widely accessible tax-funded or subsidised government healthcare and Brunei nationals, who do not pay personal income taxes, enjoy wide-ranging health and social benefits at public expense.\n\nIn Thailand, the National Health Security Act (2002) extended healthcare coverage beyond civil servants and their dependents and employees in the formal (private) sector to the majority of the population who previously had limited access to healthcare.\n\nThe Philippines National Health Insurance Program (PhilHealth), established in 1995, reported that 79 percent of Filipinos were covered by 2013. Indonesia established a national health insurance scheme (Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional) in November 2014 with the ambitious target of enrolling 121.6 million citizens in the first year and achieving universal coverage for a projected 250 million citizens by 2019.\n\nUniversal Health Coverage (UHC), in a national context, often translates however into citizen entitlements, leaving migrant workers – documented and undocumented – refugees and asylum seekers to fall through the cracks.\n\nNot surprisingly, labour-sending countries favour more generous “quasi-citizen” access to social benefits for migrant workers in their host countries: “Our collective efforts are needed in the Asean to support reforms that will enable migrant workers to find safe, legal and decent work and to work in dignity and with the support, not only of the government of their home countries, but also of the government of their host countries,” said Social Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo, chair of the ASCC pillar.\n\nDuring the meeting, Ms Taguiwalo also urged the delegates to work together to protect all migrant workers and treat them as they would their own citizens when they are in need.\n\nThe three labour-receiving Asean countries, however – Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand – appear more preoccupied with a different category of health-seeking foreigner, namely, “medical tourists”, which in Malaysia and Singapore may also include migrant workers with private insurance coverage.\n\nThe Malaysian federal government, for instance, which controls the second largest listed healthcare provider in the world, IHH Healthcare, focuses more on an integrated regional health market than on regionally harmonised social policy.\n\nOn June 24, 2017, following its earlier public forums on regional labour migration, SEA Junction, in collaboration with the Heinrich Böll Stiftung, convened a panel (Jiruth Sriratanaban, Chan Chee Khoon and Rebecca Farber) to lead a discussion on “Seeking Health Across the Border”, at the Bangkok Art & Culture Centre.\n\nIt soon became clear that a very basic issue, the lack of a uniform definition of a “medical traveller”, which had been demonstrably operationalised by reporting sources, remained problematical, whether in a regional overview or in national reports. The resulting patchy and quite ambiguous statistics allow for wildly diverging estimates and pronouncements.\n\nCiting an OECD publication by Lunt and colleagues (2011: “we can narrow down the number of medical tourists worldwide as lying somewhere between 60,000 and 50 million”), health economist David Reisman acknowledged that “speculation abounds…it is not even certain that the market is growing”.\n\nThe reasons for this state of affairs are well known: the conflation, in reported statistics, of treatment-seeking travellers with treatment seeking episodes by migrant labourers, resident expatriates, foreign retirees, foreign students, vacationing tourists, multiple counting (and sometimes, under-counting), on top of the elastic boundaries of the category “healthcare” as notions of etiology (causation of ill health, determinants of well-being) become more encompassing.\n\nIn 2011 for instance, the Malaysian state of Penang, which accounted for 60-70 percent of foreign patients who travelled to Malaysia expressly for the purpose of seeking treatment, reported that 95 percent of these Penang-bound patients were from Indonesia. By contrast, only 57 percent of the more encompassing category of foreign passport holders treated in Malaysia in toto, were Indonesian nationals.\n\nUnlike the medical tourists much welcomed in Asean member states, migrant workers are often perceived as an added imposition on overburdened public services, if not as freeloaders. In fact, migrants in Malaysia pay about four times the user charges levied on Malaysians at government hospitals, under a mandatory hospitalisation and surgical insurance scheme that costs RM120 (about $28) annually with maximum reimbursements of RM10,000 (about $2,326).\n\nMigrant workers in Malaysia also contribute significantly to public finances through annual levies (currently RM640-1,850, about $149-$430) paid for by the workers, along with assorted administrative charges and consumption taxes.\n\nThese levies and charges translate into de facto income taxes which are quite regressive. For example, migrants earning RM1,000/month would be paying a de facto income tax rate of 9-19 percent, which would put them in the same tax bracket as that of a mid-career academician in Malaysia, without the citizen entitlements of the latter.\n\nA Malaysian citizen earning the same minimum wage income as the migrant worker would be paying 0.6 percent of his or her annual salary as income taxes (more likely zero after tax deductibles).\n\nSince regimes of taxation and social entitlements vary across Asean countries, a multilateral agreement among Asean member states on contributory options for migrants, which would entitle them and their dependents to designated “citizen-equivalent” social benefits in their host country, should perhaps avoid a one-size-fits-all approach.\n\nAn approach customised to the evolving taxation and social entitlement regimes of respective Asean member states may better accommodate, and build upon, the diversity of such regimes in the region.\n\nThe envisaged multilateral agreement for instance might adopt the generic principle that mandatory contributory regimes of the host country, including income taxes, could be extended to migrant workers, who in return would be entitled to (designated?) social benefits (on the same terms?) as are available to local citizens.\n\nThis, arguably, might have better political traction among the decision makers and general public of the host countries, than a narrowly rights-based discourse and approach to social benefits and entitlements for labour migrants.\n\nChan Chee Khoon, ScD (Epidemiology), is a research fellow on Health and Social Policy at the Centre for Research in International & Comparative Education, Faculty of Education, University of Malaya.

The five-city Sales Mission went to Ahmedabad, Pune, Bengaluru, Coimbatore and Chandigarh on August 1,3,7,9 and 11.\n\n\n\nThe latest data from January to May 2017 showed that there were 183,558 Indian visits to Indonesia which is an increase of 20.72% as compared to the same period from last year.\n\n\n\n“The quota of participants for sales mission to India is always full so we always provide extra quota. For this sales mission there were 22 participants of the original 20 slots,” explained Vinsensius Jemadu, Director, Asia Pacific Promotion.\n\n\n\nThis high growth and also increasing demand prompted an opening of the air routes between India and Indonesia. After Garuda Indonesia opened flight route from Mumbai to Jakarta on December 12 2016, Indonesia AirAsia soon followed by opening Mumbai-Denpasar (Bali) route on May 20, 2017 utilising wide body aircraft of Airbus A330 and just recently on July 24, 2017, Batik Air, a subsidiary of Lion Air Group, opened Chennai-Denpasar route. However all these flights still require transits in either Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\n\n“The Ministry of Tourism greatly expect more airlines will follow the move taken by Garuda Indonesia, AirAsia and Batik Air to open flight routes connecting India and Indonesia,” wished I Gde Pitana, Deputy Minister, International Tourism Development. “The opportunity to open direct flights is widely open as there are still plenty of origination cities yet to be connected directly to Indonesia for example New Delhi, Bangalore and other big Indian cities,” added Pitana.\n\n\n\n“Over 50% of Indian tourists visiting Indonesia entered through the Ngurah Rai International Airport of Bali,” said Jemadu. The fact is considered as a challenge by the Ministry of how to introduce other destinations in Indonesia to Indian visitors. “Even in Bali, most Indians only roam around popular destinations such as Kuta, Seminyak and Ubud,” continued Jemadu. Therefore, the content for the upcoming sales missions is not only centered around business meeting (table top meeting) activities between Indian and Indonesian tourism industries, but there will also be an “Indonesian tourism update” presentation in order to reveal the development of Indonesian tourism especially about the “Top 10 New Destinations” or often dubbed the “10 New Balis”, namely: Lake Toba, Tanjung Kelayang, Tanjung Lesung, Seribu Islands, the Borobudur, Bromo-Tengger-Semeru cluster, Mandalika, Labuan Bajo, Wakatobi and Morotai.

Well, it’s complicated\n\nIt is easy to perceive the appeal of this popular city. Yogyakarta, often viewed as a beacon of traditional Javanese culture, is a gateway to two Unesco World Heritage Sites and the home of the Kraton, the palace of a royal dynasty that continues to govern until this present day.\n\nThese icons, combined with a multitude of universities, friendly locals and a flourishing arts scene, have historically created a genteel, cultured and laid-back atmosphere that has appealed to Yogyakarta’s many visitors over the years.\n\nHowever, Yogyakarta’s booming tourism industry has created challenges that potentially threaten the very characteristics that made Yogyakarta so appealing in the first place. Of particular concern are increasing pressures on tourism infrastructure, and the possibility of cultural clashes as the presence of international tourism is felt more widely and pervasively throughout Yogyakarta.\n\nYogyakarta’s infrastructure challenges have manifested in a variety of ways, such as more frequent instances of traffic congestion, and an airport that has had to handle more than twice its official capacity of passengers annually.\n\nA post shared by YOGYAKARTA (@explorejogja) on Sep 5, 2017 at 3:36am PDT\n\nIn addition, rampant hotel construction has negatively impacted water resources, according to Universitas Gajah Mada, a top public research university located in Yogyakarta. Governments at various levels have made efforts to tackle some of these issues.\n\nThe Jokowi government has commissioned the construction of a new international airport in Yogyakarta that will have a capacity of 50 million passengers annually, and well-known tourist and shopping strip Malioboro has been modified by Yogyakarta’s authorities to become more pedestrian-friendly in the eyes of some locals and visitors, however, much remains to be done.\n\nSEE ALSO: Indonesia may limit number of visitors in Borobudur temple grounds\n\nShofi, who lives overseas but returns to her home in Yogyakarta annually, has noticed the change over the years: “The traffic has become worse over the last few years … almost as bad as Jakarta sometimes, and public transport needs to be improved.”\n\nIn order to reduce the volume of traffic around the city center while continuing to attract more tourists, the government has begun plans to establish tourist areas outside the city, especially in the regency of Bantul.\n\nAccording to information provided to Travel Wire Asia, one of the government projects in the pipeline is Atala Dwipa, an ambitious 1000ha tourist complex that will offer visitors a range of attractions in areas of eco-tourism, adventure tourism and local culture.\n\nPart of the complex will also cater to corporate travelers and MICE delegates by providing meetings and conference facilities. Regional projects like Atala Dwipa are intended to provide economic opportunities to rural communities while simultaneously reducing pressure on infrastructure in the city.\n\nHowever, establishing new centers of tourism may present its own challenges, especially on to the periphery of Yogyakarta. Elements of conservative Yogyakartan society may not be prepared for the cultural clashes that can emerge as the presence of foreign tourists becomes more pervasive outside of the city.\n\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that some residents of Yogyakarta are still unaccustomed to the more liberal fashion styles and behavior sometimes displayed by foreigners who visit local beaches.\n\nWatch a traveling couple @ocean.dwellers marvel at the sunset from the top of Borobudur Temple in Java. #WonderfulIndonesia pic.twitter.com/TiYyErHDco — Indonesia.Travel (@indtravel) September 3, 2017\n\nZaya (not her real name), a tourism consultant who advises institutional investors, told Travel Wire Asia that some of her high net-worth clients and associates are interested but hesitant towards investing in Yogyakarta’s tourism sector due to a potential “cultural mismatch” between local communities and foreign tourists.\n\n“Unlike the Balinese, people in Yogyakarta are not used to foreigners walking around in bikinis.”\n\nThis is a view contradicted by Yogyakarta Chamber of Commerce vice-chairman Wawan Harmawan, who told Travel Wire Asia that social adjustment to a greater influx of tourists is unnecessary as “Yogyakarta is already established as a world-class tourist destination and, up until now, the simplicity of daily life in Yogyakarta has not been affected”.\n\nIndeed, the contemporary flavor of well-known Yogyakartan artists such as hip-hop outfit Jogja Hip Hop Foundation and visual artist Eko Nugroho point to the large extent to which Western culture has permeated Yogyakartan society.\n\nNevertheless, if Yogyakarta wants to position itself as global tourist hub, adjustments will have to be made at various levels. As Shofi put it, “The government will have to prepare in terms of infrastructure, and the society will have to prepare in terms of its culture.”'),

Source: zjuzjaka/Sutterstock\n\nWELLNESS tourism, one the industry’s fastest growing sector with a 10 percent rise this year, promotes travel for one’s health through psychological, physical, or spiritual activities – or all three.\n\nIn this super stressed modern world, wellness tourism is highly appealing as it encourages travellers to practice mindfulness and to “find their centre.” The positive uptake and exponential growth have made wellness tourism a multi-billion dollar market.\n\nThis brand of travellers is mostly carefree and less discerning, with just their wellbeing on their minds. But a recent controversy may have just thrown a spanner in the works.\n\nLast week, news emerged that 14 tourists have claimed sexual assault by guru at Agama Yoga, a yoga centre located on the idyllic island of Koh Phangan in Thailand.\n\nSEE ALSO: In Hong Kong, authorities stumble as sexual predators thrive online\n\nOn its website, the wellness paradise described itself as “a true spiritual university whose core principles are centered in bringing the authentic roots of yoga to life through courses, workshops, and retreats, at campuses around the world.”\n\n“We guide students to cultivate clarity and spiritual refinement, thus empowering the individual with a balanced approach to living. Providing support to an aspiring student who is willing to live to their fullest, we provide the roadmap for the journey towards awakening,” it claims.\n\nAgama Yoga exists under the watchful eyes of its teachers including its charismatic leader “guru” Swami Vivekananda Saraswati, whose real name is Narcis Tarcau.\n\nThe centre offers yoga courses, a variety of workshops including astrology and metaphysics, retreats, and teacher training.\n\nThis includes a Tantra workshop which aims to teach students how to “transform lovemaking into a liberating spiritual experience” and “develop deeper, longer orgasms.”\n\nBut 16 former pupils and staff (14 women and two men) got more than they bargained for.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, they said they felt a “sex cult” was operating inside the retreat and that it has been happening for 15 years.\n\nThe 14 women, from the UK, Australia, Brazil, US, and Canada spoke to The Guardian on the condition of anonymity. Three claimed they were raped by Tarcau while the rest alleged he sexually assaulted them in the name of helping them achieve enlightenment.\n\nSEE ALSO: Sex and money: The link between reproductive rights and economic prosperity\n\n“The alleged assaults included Tarcau penetrating women with his fingers against their will, aggressively groping them, or performing sex acts on them without consent. When they said ‘no,’ the women claim Tarcau would say ‘I know what’s best for you,’ before forcing himself on them,” The Guardian reported.\n\nBoth male and female students claimed the culture of inappropriate sexual conduct was “endemic” at Agama Yoga. At least two senior male teachers have also been accused of sexual violence.\n\nBut they stayed on for years due to what they claimed was “brainwashing.”\n\nThis is not the first time controversy has rocked the wellness tourism industry.\n\nLast year, yoga teacher Uma Inder was accused of using the world famous Yoga Barn in Ubud, Bali to operate a cult from 2008 until she was fired in 2016.\n\nLike Tarcau, she groomed potential members with promises of “enlightenment,” a process that included verbally and physically assaulting members and sleeping with students.\n\n“She frequently compared herself to Jesus and said she was God, Kal, and Death. Uma told devotees they will feel ‘raped’ by working with her and that they’d actually become Uma while making love.”\n\nInitially, Yoga Barn founder Meghan Pappenheim dismissed the complaints as a “witch hunt” against Uma. However, it was later revealed that Pappenheim had sent Inder a formal “Cessation of Cooperation” letter on May 24, 2016.\n\nOn its Facebook page, Agama Yoga posted up a series of status updates regarding the incident, the earliest being July 26, 2018.\n\n“Considering the severity of these allegations, Swami has taken the decision to step back from all his administrative and teaching responsibilities in order for the situation to be investigated without additional provocation,” it wrote, adding that it will “focus on the important tasks of restructuring our internal policies and reflecting on the current situation.”\n\nThen, on Aug 5, 2018, Agama Yoga head of school and founding member Ananda Maha, whose real name is Dr. Mihaiela Pentiuc took to Facebook to ask, “Is the current media war authentically fought in the name of supporting the women who have been affected or is it aimed at closing down the school?”\n\nPentiuc added, “We at Agama, we encourage women to come forward. We want to listen, help and assure their privacy. How can we offer these, if the school is constantly demonised? Please let me remind everyone that these allegations are against individuals and not against the school.”\n\nOn Aug 11, 2018, the centre wrote yet another status claiming a high-profile hate campaign has been launched against Agama Yoga and that “the entire yoga and healthy living community in Koh Phangan is now under threat and scrutiny.\n\n“The relentless hatred is spreading like an infectious disease in all vicinity as well as internationally.”\n\nAgama Yoga has since launched an independent inquiry.\n\nMeanwhile, Tarcau, as well as the senior male teachers, is believed to have left Koh Phangan after allegations first surfaced in July. Agama Yoga has confirmed it has “removed” all accused male teachers as well.\n\nIn its latest Facebook status update, the center said it was also critically reviewing both the entire sexual Tantra curriculum as well as the yoga curriculum and working relentlessly for the reconstruction Agama Yoga.\n\nThis article originally appeared on our sister site Travel Wire Asia.'),

It also now has okay hotels, a web of air links and some comfortable if slow trains, at least in Java.\n\nYet what seems singularly lacking to this recent visitor is much sense of pride in its history which could be communicated to tourists who want to do more than lie on beaches, climb volcanoes or simply enjoy the scenery.\n\nThe 1,200-year-old temples of Borobudur (Buddhist) and Prambanan (Hindu) close to Yogyakarta are World Heritage sites that clearly qualify as wonderful. Yet visiting them again for the first time in more than a decade this tourist was struck by the total lack on information available to explain the stories and the symbolism of the successive tiers of stone carvings which comprise this remarkable building. No guidebooks even in Bahasa, let alone English, Chinese, Japanese, etc.\n\nVisitors interested in more than taking photos of the temple and themselves need to either have acquired a guide book before they arrive – which is difficult – or pay for the services of a local guide who can explain some of the basics and point out a few of the most noteworthy features. Ones speaking various languages are available but this is not cheap, the guides’ knowledge appears limited and does not provide visitors with a record of the building which they can keep as mementoes and study at their leisure. Nor is there much sense that this is a religious monument which requires as much respect as a mosque or church. Much the same situation prevails at Prambanan.\n\nAt Borobudur, exhibits in the nearby museum are poorly displayed. Lack of information also means few visit the nearby museum housing the Samudraraksa, the replica of a ship illustrated by Borobudur reliefs which in 2003 was sailed from Jakarta to the Seychelles, Madagascar, Cape Town and Accra (Ghana). Built with traditional tools and materials, the ship provides the most tangible reminder of the sailing feats of the Indonesians who settled Madagascar and traded to Africa and Arabia in the first millennium, and later.\n\nA book about the expedition exists published by the Lontar Foundation– this writer has one from a previous visit – but is no longer available at the museum. Yet at a time when President Joko Widodo is focusing attention on the contemporary importance of maritime issues, Indonesia should be making as much fuss about its achievements as China does with Zheng He’s voyages nearly a thousand years later.\n\nPerhaps modern Indonesia has become so concerned with being Islamic that it forgets that its most celebrated achievements predate the arrival of Islam. Not that there is much sense of pride in Java’s first mosques. Built in the north Java towns, Demak, Kudus and Jepara, then trading cities, the mixture of local Hindu, Chinese and Persian influences in their (very different) designs provide a fascinating insight into how Islam arrived with trade. Yet do not expect to find much information on site, let alone in multiple languages.\n\nThat is again the case for tourists who, starting from Yogya or Semarang, take the slow but stunningly beautiful winding road through precariously terraced hillsides to the mist-enshrouded 7th century Hindu temples, bubbling volcanic rocks and sulphurous lakes 2,000 meters up on Central Java’s Dieng Plateau. This “abode of the gods,” once home to dozens of temples of which a few are left, was the spiritual center of the Sanjaya dynasty. Understandably, foreigners have to pay more than locals to visit. But unless a visitor arrives with a guidebook, there is nothing to explain the history and significance of the site.\n\nJakarta with its traffic, pollution and shortage of historic buildings cannot be high up on any tourist’s itinerary. Yet, given its collections at the National Museum, situated on the west side of Merdeka square opposite the National Monument, should be a place for showing Indonesia’s history and culture. But the exhibits are bizarrely organized and poorly presented. Some important artefacts lack any description or one only in Bahasa. Part of the museum housing large statuary is currently closed for renovation so maybe eventually the whole museum will emerge rejuvenated. But there is a long way to go – and also a need for the kind of guidebook, in several languages, which is the norm at most significant museums.\n\nAll told, this visitor’s experience of a few days sightseeing was that if the responsible authorities in Indonesia had a greater sense of national pride, the tourist would come away with a much better impression. The apparent official disinterest in showing off the history and achievements of its peoples contrasts with the efforts of a private group, the Lontar Foundation, to preserve legacies such as illuminated Javanese manuscripts, and the Bugis chronicle, La Galigo, and promote modern Indonesian culture and writing, including having success in bringing its authors to international attention.'),

Set three hour\'s drive from the original surfing mecca of Kuta on the island little-visited west coast, the tiny village offers glimpses of the Bali of yesteryear: emerald-green rice fields, local children swimming in creeks, bamboo shacks where you can get a meal or a massage for a few dollars and long empty volcanic beaches littered with coconut husks and palm fronds.\n\nThen there are the waves: curved mirrors of water ranging from two to 10 feet, including the longest left-hand point break on the Island of the Gods. "When conditions are right, you can ride waves for up to one-and-a-half minutes here," says Mike Holzrichter, the Austrian manager of Medewi Surf Homestay.\n\nBut things have changed in Medewi since Holzrichter chanced upon this surfer\'s paradise nearly a decade ago. "Back then, there would be maybe 20 people on the point – mostly locals and a couple of blow-ins from Kuta. But today there can be up to 100 surfers on any given day. And they\'re all hungry for waves. They forget the rules. It makes it hard to chill in the line-up."\n\nSHARE\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare on Twitter\n\nPin to Pinterest\n\nLink "Dropping in" and other poor surf etiquette has made what was once a peaceful surf experience more aggressive and even dangerous in some cases. Photo: Ian Lloyd Neubauer\n\nMuklis, a professional surfer who like many Indonesians goes by only one name, is also nostalgic about Medewi\'s good old days. "Back when I was a kid, it was super mellow, good fun vibes, with everyone in the line-up talking to one another and sharing waves. The tourists respected the locals and that is how it should be. But nowadays tourists are so much more aggressive. They all want to get waves and forget what surfing is all about."\n\nProjectiles and drop-ins\n\nHolzrichter and Muklis are not waxing lyrical, as I discover when I paddle out to Medewi\'s left-hand at high-tide during the August peak season. The waves are fun but not challenging in a real way, breaking slowly and consistently, which makes them perfect for beginners.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem: many of the tourists who come to Medewi know nothing about or care little for surfing etiquette. Not two minutes after I get into the water, I see a beginner make a concerted but flawed effort to stand up on her board that sees her quickly wiped out. But instead of pulling in her leg rope she lets it go, turning her surfboard into a dangerous overwater projectile. Then I hear a scream followed by a fiery round of expletives as said surfboard scores a direct hit on a local\'s face. Because she\'s a girl and because she apologises with haste, the local, who isn\'t injured, lets it go. But in many other surfing spots around the world, the incident could easily have escalated into fisticuffs.\n\n"Down in Uluwatu," Muklis says of the world-famous surf break set under the soaring limestone cliffs of Bali\'s southernmost peninsula, fights between tourists and locals happen every day. But in Medewi they happen only once a year. We are village people so you really have to push us to make us mad. The last time it happened was a few months ago when a tourist dropped in on me three times in a row. It didn\'t end well for him."\n\n\'Dropping in\' refers to a surfer in the line-up who catches or tries to catch a wave another person is already surfing. It\'s considered a crime in the surf world and the first things any surfing instructor worth their salt teaches their students not to do.\n\nThe Canggu conundrum\n\nCanggu, pronounced \'Chan-goo\', lies one hour\'s drive north of Kuta Beach. Ten years ago it didn\'t look too different to Medewi, a coastal village crisscrossed with rice fields where surfers looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta went to chill out and ride empty waves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as Bali rode the tourism wave that now sees a whopping 5 million holidaymakers descend upon the island every year, mass tourism hit Canggu and the village began to change. Today there are more luxury villas and cocktail bars than there are rice fields in Canggu, while the beachfront is lined with dozens upon dozens of surfboard hire shops and surf schools. A number of these businesses offer day trips to Medewi, stuffing up to eight beginners and only one instructor and into a van.\n\n"I don\'t mind if surfers come and stay in a local guesthouse for a few days. It\'s good for us and gives us money to send our children to school," Muklis says. "But those who come up just for the day with surf camps from Canggu, they don\'t contribute anything to the local economy. This is the kind of crowd we don\'t want in Medewi. On some days we get not just one van but four or five of vans full of Canggu people crowding up our waves. And because the instructor-to-student ratio is so low, we get all these beginners dropping in on us and letting go of their boards."\n\nGive back to the community\n\nMuklis and other members of the Medewi Boardriders Club – a group that holds weekly clean-ups on the beach and teaches local kids how to surf – have tried speaking to some of the instructors from Canggu about the problem. "But they\'re just employees, they have no say in what they do and if they complain to their bosses they could lose their jobs," Muklis says. "Their bosses never come up here. They hide in Canggu."\n\nThe solution, Mike opines, lies in affirmative action by the tourists themselves. "There are plenty of surf camps in Medewi," he says. "They can rent a car or motorbike in Canggu or just catch a taxi – it\'s not too expensive. That way, their money helps the local community."\n\nMuklis concurs: "For sure that is the best way. And here the instructors care more and teach them the rules. That way we\'ll get respect: respect for locals and respect for our waves."\n\nHave you experienced a similar paradise suffer the tirade of tourism?

We opened our first hotel in Phuket in 2007. So we’ve been present in the region for a while, but it’s just recently started to turn into a more significant region for us,” says senior vice president for human resources Craig Cochrane. “What we’ve wanted to do is bring the executive team here, spend time with owning companies, seeing the properties, seeing hotels that are under construction, meeting potential owning companies, just to get a very personalized feeling for the area and to become familiar with the various different markets.”\n\nAndrew Langdon, chief development officer and senior vice president for Asia, adds that the company has taken notice of Asia because of its great market potential.\n\nIn the Philippines, Mövenpick has been operating in Mactan, Cebu since 2011. The contemporary five-star beachfront resort features 245 rooms and suites. “It is out- performing the actual market,” Langdon reports.\n\nThe executive team is also excited to be opening a second property in Boracay before the end of the year. Mövenpick Resort & Spa Boracay will open on the island’s idyllic Punta Bunga Beach and is set to become one of the destination’s leading resorts.\n\nThe five-star resort boasts of 333 rooms and suites. Located at a more private part of the popular tourist island, the resort’s beach has Bora- cay’s famed fine sand. “It’s gorgeous, it’s amazing,” says senior vice president- commercial Paul Mulcahy. “There’s something for every- body, from a romantic holiday to a family trip,” he adds, highlighting the wide array of food choices with seven different food and beverage outlets; a Little Birds Club for young guests; the Mövenpick world-famous beach club; Chocolate Hour, among other attractions. The resort will also feature the largest swimming pool on the island and the only casino in Boracay.\n\n“We think with the Swiss DNA of our brand and that consistency and focus on detail married with the Philippine or Asian culture really is a great plan,” says Mulcahy.\n\nThe executive committee has worked with many Filipinos in the hotel industry abroad, says Cochrane, who says that the Philippine properties embody “a combination of the ‘Swissness’ of the company and the natural warmth of the Philippine people.”\n\nHe adds, “Quality and pre- cision are two of the hallmarks of Switzerland. Usually when people think of Switzerland, they think of banks, fancy watches, the best chocolate in the world. That’s very important in our hotel setting, because if you say to our guest, ‘We’ll deliver your laundry within two hours,’ then you should deliver it in two hours. We find that our Filipino col- leagues understand that very well, they take it very seriously and they seem to want to always strive and learn and get better at what they do. So I think that combination has been very successful for us.”\n\nMövenpick president and CEO Olivier Chavy likewise has taken notice of the country’s potential in the tourism market. “The Philippines presents strong development potential for Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts... It is one of Asia’s fastest-growing tourism markets and offers a wide range of destination possibilities that are currently untapped by upscale hospitality brands. With two properties under our management al- ready, we are now seeking further opportunities to grow our footprint in key locations across the country including the capital, Manila.”\n\nWith growing interest in the Asian market, the company now operates 10 hotels and resorts in several Asian destinations, with five hotels and resorts in Thailand and one property in each of the following countries – the Philippines, China, Indonesia, Vietnam and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe executive team adds their long-term goal is to further build on the company’s Asian portfolio by 2020. There are already 17 new projects signed, all of which are on track to open by 2020, growing the Asia portfolio to 27 properties in the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Bangladesh, China and the Maldives.\n\nTalks are also ongoing with potential potential owning companies in Palawan and Manila.

We’ve been to millions of islands and I would say it’s the most beautiful one," Canadian Angelika Redweik-Leung said at a lookout above the Pianemo island group.\n\nRaja Ampat -- which means Four Kings -- is made up of 1,500 islands and is home to about 1,400 varieties of fish and 600 species of coral -- making it one of the most biodiverse marine habitats on earth.\n\nIndonesia\'s government is intent on turning the area into a tourism hotspot, building hotels, restaurants and investing in new harbours.\n\nBut on a palm-fringed island about two hours boat ride from Raja Ampat\'s capital Waisai, villagers still live in simple huts that lack electricity and clean water, while the nearest high school is scores of miles away.\n\nLocals told AFP they had seen no improvements to their lives despite the dramatic rise in visitors. According to government estimates around 15,000 tourists now come to the area each year -- up from less than 5,000 in 2010.\n\n"They\'ve hurt us indigenous people. They took our land, our water and our forest. We feel betrayed," Paul Mayor, chief of the island\'s Byak Betew tribe, said of the government\'s tourism drive.\n\n"That\'s our land, our ocean, which now is a world-class tourist destination, but we\'ve gained nothing from the influx of tourists," he added.\n\nMayor also criticised authorities for failing to properly protect the area\'s unique ecosystem, pointing to a catastrophic cruise ship crash in March, which damaged 13,500 square metres of pristine coral reef.\n\nThe 4,200-ton Caledonian Sky ran aground near the island of Kri carrying 102 passengers and 79 crew, but half a year later no one has been held accountable.\n\n- \'We are still poor\' -\n\nResearchers from the University of Papua, who assessed the impact of the accident, said restoring the damaged reef could cost as much as $16.2 million.\n\nThe head of tourism for Raja Ampat, Yusdi Lamatenggo, said the company operating the boat -- Noble Caledonia -- will be summoned to appear in court soon but so far they have not accepted responsibility or paid any damages.\n\nIn the meantime, he told AFP, steps were being taken to prevent further accidents by establishing clearly demarcated cruise ship routes and world-class harbours.\n\nBut the accident has fuelled feelings of mistrust and exclusion often felt by Papua\'s indigenous Melanesian population. The resource-rich region was annexed by Jakarta in 1969 and most Papuans feel they have not been given an even share of its natural riches.\n\nThe military retains heavy influence in the region and regularly stifles dissent.\n\nAfter taking office in 2014, president Joko Widodo pledged to speed up development in Papua, but many locals insist they have been forgotten.\n\n"There has been no change," Ariel Fakdawer, head of Saukabu village in Raja Ampat told AFP.\n\n"The yearly Raja Ampat festival, for example, attracts thousands of tourists but we gain nothing from that. We are still poor, but the organizers of such festivals, outsiders, they have made a fortune," he added.\n\nIndigenous groups say they need communication satellites, electricity, better infrastructure, and the right to govern themselves by customary law.\n\n"The government never fulfils our needs because they don\'t understand what we want," chief Mayor said.\n\n"I believe the government has to approach us by bearing in mind our cultural needs. They have to talk to us indigenous people," he insisted.\n\nBut not everyone is against the rush to open up Raja Ampat to the world.\n\nVillager Medzke Karoswaf explained: "This is a modern world.

They are not worried about the volcanic activity of Mount Agung," Gayatri affirmed.\n\n\n\nPopular tourist sites are far from Mount Agung. As a result, tourism activities remain safe.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Ngurah Rai International Airport is also far from the mount. Flights, both domestic and international, are still running smoothly.\n\n\n\n"Therefore, there is no reason to worry about the safety of traveling in Bali," she emphasized.\n\n\n\nGayatri also regretted the spreading of hoax news and exaggerated reporting that caused panic among the people.\n\n\n\nA total of 150 pianists, from within the country and abroad, took part in the event.\n\n\n\nPianists from several countries, such as Australia, France, America, Japan, Korea, and Singapore, participated in the competition.\n\n\n\nEach participant will be escorted by his family. One pianist can bring at least five members of his family.\n\n\n\n"They will book hotel rooms and visit tourism spots in Bali. They will go shopping, enjoy culinary, and cultural performances. They are middle and upper class tourists with big expenses," Gayatri pointed out.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the competition will serve as a boost for the tourism industry in Bali.\n\n\n\nIn 2016, the tourist destination of Bali Island received 4.92 million foreign tourists, an increase of 23.14 percent over the previous year, which was recorded at 4.001 million people.\n\n\n\nBased on data from Bali Central Statistics Agency (BPS), as many as 4.85 million people take flights directly from their country through Ngurah Rai Airport, and the remaining 75,303 people travel through the sea port.\n\n\n\nThe number of foreign tourist arrivals in Bali from Jan to Aug 2017 had reached 3.99 million, an increase of 25 percent as compared to that recorded during the same period last year.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Chairman of Bali Open Piano Competition 2017, Eleonora Aprilita, congratulated the winners of the competition.\n\n\n\n"Please, be a pianist who is reliable. The competition is very important to develop the skills of young pianists. The young pianists can show their talents in playing classical music," she added.\n\n\n\nAprilita noted that the event has attracted a lot of participants, especially foreign tourists with high spending.\n\n\n\nParticipants from a total of 12 categories have competed in the event.\n\n\n\nThe category of choice songs is divided into six categories, namely A, which includes participants who are maximum 7 years old; B, which includes participants who are between the age of 8 and 9; C, which includes participants who are between the age of 10 and 11; D, which includes participants who are between the age of 12 and 14; E, which includes participants who are between the age of 15 and 17; and F, which includes participants who are minimum 18 years of age.\n\n\n\nThen, there are six free categories, free of A-F, who will compete to play the piano with Baroque theme, which is the composers work of 1600-1750; classical era, which is the composers work of 1750-1820; romantic era, which is composers work in the early 1800s-1900s; and modern times, the work of composers in the 20th and 21st century.\n\n\n\nThe Bali Open Piano Competition 2017 takes place in two rounds. In the preliminary round, participants must play one song. Participants selected in the next round must play one song. Songs played in the final round should not be the same as those played in the preliminary round.\n\n\n\n"We have announced the winners under each category. The winners will receive trophies, winning certificates, and prizes from the sponsors. All participants will get a certificate," she stated.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Yuhana Okumura (12), a pianist from Japan, said that she was not worried about the volcanic activity of Mount Agung.\n\n\n\n"The committee has explained clearly to my parents about the condition of Gunung Agung. There is nothing to worry about," Okumura stated.\n\n\n\nWith regard to the competition, Okumura said that the event could increase her skills in playing classical piano songs.\n\n\n\n"I have trained for four months on the songs played in prestigious piano event.

The competition provides us knowledge on classical songs. I really enjoy the songs," Cordir stated.\n\n\n\nHead of the Bali Tourism Office, Anak Agung Gede Yuniartha Putra, earlier said that the Bali Tourism Board had sent an appeal to tourism-related parties all over the world to visit Bali without any hesitation.\n\n\n\nHe urged the media to not exaggerate reports on Mount Agung showing signs of volcanic activity.\n\n\n\nHe regretted a report by an Australian television channel claiming that Mount Agung spewed smoke into the air, when in reality, it did not happen.\n\n\n\n"I think Australian people are smart and know the condition in Bali.

Japan doesn’t have a sea and I believe that the people will be mesmerized by the beauty of Bali, they also love the culture of Yogyakarta. Currently, Bali’s competitor is Hawaii, we believe if there are more direct flights, Japanese will forget about Hawaii,” told Makiko.\n\nMeanwhile, tourism minister Arief Yahya also seemed to be very positive about the Japanese market. He mentioned that the ministry’s role is to make regulations that make it easier for the tourism industry to develop its business.\n\n“Industry leads, the government supports. It is what is needed to build a business ecosystem that gives room for development,” Arief said.\n\n“The government should never become a [tour] operator. The government only acts as a regulator, the operator part is the [tourism] industry’s job,” he added. (asw)'),

In the 2018 government work plan (RKP), there are three leading sectors that are listed in the plan: Agriculture, Tourism and Fishery.\n\n“I often discuss with the President about the core industries of this nation that will contribute the most for the country,” Arief said.\n\nIn manufacturing, for example, not a single country can compete against China for this industry. The situation is similar with information, where the five best companies in the industry are American companies.\n\n“So now there are only creative economy and tourism, I said that there’s a possibility that we will be the biggest and the best in the region and globally,” he added, also noting that the nation’s main core is cultural industry and this has the potential to be huge.\n\nArief moreover said he felt a bit odd if the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) doesn\'t measure tourism industry’s contribution to the GDP, foreign exchange and labor.\n\n“If tourism has been set as a leading sector, it would be odd if BPS doesn’t measure those things,” the minister said.\n\nRead also: Despite infrastructure issues, Nihi Sumba Island named world’s best hotel\n\nIndonesia is included in The Telegraph\'s list of Top 20 Fastest Growing Travel Destinations in the World, which means that the nation’s growth rate is on par with the global standard.\n\n“ASEAN itself has the [tourism] growth of six percent, so does the world’s growth rate. But Indonesia has the rate of 24 percent, four times than the regional and global growth,” Arief explained.\n\nMeanwhile, the neighboring country Malaysia who the minister considers as the country’s biggest competitors has a decrease in its tourism growth with the rate is under five percent.\n\nIn 2016 Indonesia has won 46 awards in 22 countries, the Wonderful Indonesia tourism brand is in the 47th spot in the global ranking whilst Thailand is at the 83rd spot and Malaysia is at the 96th spot.\n\nRecently, Indonesia won the people’s choice awards and East Asia and Pacific region categories at the UNWTO Video Competition.\n\nRead also: How to handle unexpected emergencies while traveling\n\nArief explained that to become a global player, a global standard needs to be implemented and for this matter Arief is referring to the 14 pillars of Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (TCCI) by World Economic Forum (WEF).\n\nOut of the 14 pillars, Indonesia wins at price competitiveness whilst its weakest point is at environmental sustainability.\n\nBack in 2015, Indonesia jumped up 20 spots to the 70th position and for this year Indonesia takes the 42nd spot out of 181 countries that are being assessed by WEF.\n\nWhen it comes to tourism events, a good preparation is very important. Arief admitted that the ministry’s events always have a problem in time consistency.\n\nThe next problem is budget management, “These two things need the commitment from CEOs and district heads. If a mayor and regent is unable to hold [an event] the event will then get rescheduled, this is what’s wrong,” he said.\n\nArief is committed to providing the budget for promotion and publication, “Your weakness is you don’t want to invest on media hence I will be in charge for that,” he said.

It’s also worth noting the number of Indonesians who travel abroad to get medical treatment,” said Ukus.\n\nThe partnership between the two ministries involves policy and program coordination and harmonization, medical tourism improvement, development, education for the locals who live around medical tourist destinations, information and data exchange.\n\n“There’s also integrated technical mentoring, monitoring and evaluation,” Ukus added.\n\nThe tourism ministry has the responsibility to form the standard indicator for medical tourism, conduct awareness of traditional values, authenticity, uniqueness, and access, and forming a partnership between private businesses in the tourism industry and the assigned medical facilities.\n\n“Tourism ministry is also tasked with forming a marketing strategy for medical products and services, identifying and proposing some of the leading products for medical tourism that will be patented as an intellectual property in Indonesia and the world,” told Ukus.\n\nMeanwhile, the responsibilities of healthy ministry include forming and socializing the medical tourism policy, pushing private sectors to build leading upscale hospitals and traditional health facilities.\n\nRead also: A fifth of global deaths linked to diet: Study\n\nThe next step for both ministries is to form a joined taskforce with hospital, spa and other health association representatives.\n\nIn 2006, it was estimated that there were 350,000 Indonesians who underwent medical treatment overseas with the total spending of 500 million dollars. The latest calculation estimates that there are around 600,000 Indonesians who travel overseas for medical treatment with a total spending of around 1.4 billion dollars. In comparison, countries like Thailand has successfully developed its medical tourism and resulting in 3.2 billion dollars of foreign exchange in 2011.\n\nA global survey conducted by McKinsey in 2008 on reasons why consumers like to travel overseas for a medical treatment shows that 40 percent of them are looking for the most advanced technology, 32 percent are looking for better treatment, 15 percent of them want faster medical service and only nine percent are looking for cheaper treatment.\n\nMeanwhile in Indonesia, when it comes to health and wellness, the country is most famous for its spa treatments and destinations.\n\n“The success of Bali in being the best Spa destination in the world is not yet supported by scientific principles in Indonesia and not yet patented internationally.

Calabria, in southwest Italy, or Sicily, the largest Mediterranean island just off the “toe” of Italy’s ‘boot’, are both hidden gems, starring dramatic cliffside villages, clear waters and delicious seafood.\n\nPortugal and Azores\n\nInstead of Spain, experience the food and wine culture of Portugal, or go island hopping and hike around Sao Jorge or Faial Islands in the Azores, a group of islands just off the coast of Portugal.\n\nFinland\n\nInstead of Iceland, explore Finnish Lapland in winter. It’s home of the indigenous Sami people and is a magical Arctic wonderland of pristine peaks and snow-dusted woodlands.\n\nMoldova\n\nInstead of Tuscany, enjoy the largest quality wine collection in the world without the crowds. Moldova is an Eastern European country bordered by Romania and the Ukraine.\n\nTatra Mountains\n\nInstead of the Alps, combine a sleigh ride, village visits and traditional cooking in this stunning mountain range which forms a natural border between Slovakia and Poland.'),

Through this support, we believe that Aceh will emerge as one of the main tourism destinations in the western regions of Indonesia," Aceh Governor Irwandi Yusuf said, in written address read out by Aceh Regional Government Assistant II, Syaiba Ibrahim, at the opening of the National Working Meeting of the Indonesian Tour Guides Association (HPI) in Banda Aceh, on Wednesday (Oct 4).\n\n\n\nKnown as the Veranda of Mecca, Aceh is a province located at the tip of the island of Sumatra and also the western tip of Indonesia. It apparently has many exotic and amazing tourist attractions. Thus, visiting it can provide a different and exciting experience.\n\n\n\nAceh is famous for its beautiful nature and beaches flanked by both Indian Ocean and Malacca Straits. The sensational beauty often makes tourists want to return to visit and enjoy it again. There are not only beaches but also many other places that are also interesting to visit and admire.\n\n\n\nAceh tourism objects are no less interesting than those of other cities in Indonesia. Despite the heartbreaking history of the tsunami in late 2004, the natural disaster has even added to the attraction of visitors to get closer to nature and the city of Aceh.\n\n\n\nThe popular tourist destinations in Aceh include Lampuuk Beach, Ulee Lheue Beach, Lhoknga Beach, Suhom Waterfall, Rubiah Island, Tsunami Museum, and Baiturrahman Great Mosque.\n\n\n\nThis is only a small number of the hundreds of other tourist destinations in Aceh.\n\n\n\nAccording to Yusuf, Aceh has at least 808 interesting locations that could be developed to achieve the provinces dream of becoming a major tourism destination in the western part of Indonesia.\n\n\n\n"The government continues to improve facilities and infrastructure in all tourist areas in an effort to make the guests comfortable," Yusuf remarked.\n\n\n\nHe explained that there are hundreds of tourism destinations in Aceh province, consisting of 426 natural tourism areas, 268 cultural tourism areas, and 114 special interest tourism areas. According to him, the presence of guides is very important and needs to be strengthened in order to support the development of the tourism sector in the province.\n\n\n\nThe Government of Aceh also expressed hoped that the HPI working meeting in Aceh would be able to serve as a means to strengthen the presence of guides on the Mecca Veranda.\n\n\n\nThe governor has urged other regions that have been successful in developing tour guides to share their experiences with Aceh, so that efforts to improve the tourism sector in Aceh could be realized in the future.\n\n\n\n"We are confident that by sharing experience, Aceh will be able to become one of the main tourist destinations in the western part of Indonesia," he added.\n\n\n\nChairman of the HPI Central Executive Board, Sang Putu Subaya, appreciated the initiative of the Aceh Government in supporting the DPD activities of HPI Aceh and supporting the implementation of the 17th HPI National Workshop in Aceh.\n\n\n\n"We believe that through the support and cooperation of the Aceh Government, the ideals to promote tourism in Indonesia and increase the number of tourist arrivals, especially in Aceh, will be achieved," he asserted.\n\n\n\nSubaya added that if the tourism sector develops well, then other business sectors will automatically be boosted, and the business activities of society will also be increased.\n\n\n\nHence, Yusuf is of the view that the development of tourism is also supported by the presence of tour guides who provide services to the tourists.\n\n\n\n"The main factor for developing the tourism sector not only depends on the interesting tourist areas, the complete facilities and infrastructure, and culture but also on the tour guides," Yusuf revealed.\n\n\n\nThe governor explained that the existence of HPI, as an organization of the tour guides in the country, should be strengthened in order to play an optimal role in training and empowering members to do the best for the progress of Indonesian tourism.\n\n\n\nHe added that the duty of the guides, among others, was to arrange the trip of travelers to the destination, provide explanations about travel and attractions, take care of travel documents and luggage of tourists, and provide them assistance.\n\n\n\n"Given the importance of the existence of tour guides, it is natural that the government, through the Ministry of Tourism, enforces the certification process for every tour guide working in the field, and the Aceh government is certainly very supportive of this policy," he explained.\n\n\n\nThe Government of Aceh has proposed that additional modules would be tested to prospective Aceh tour guides, namely the understanding of Islamic Sharia. With this understanding, tour guides can explain clearly about Islamic Sharia in order to prevent misinterpretation among tourists.\n\n\n\n"We have determined that the tourism sector is one of the programs that will be developed within the next five years, which has the potential to improve the peoples welfare, because Aceh has many tourist areas with high selling value," he elaborated.(*)'),

Satu hari setelah menghebohkan Jember Fashion Carnaval 2017 dengan hashtag #PesonaJFC2017, mantan Direktur Utama Telkom itu langsung memantau pergerakan daerah perbatasan yang menjadi destinasi crossborder.\n\nDeputi Bidang Pengembangan Pemasaran Nusantara pun merapatkan diri di Grand Mega Resort and Spa, Ngurah Rai, Bali. Mereka menggelar Rakor Crossborder, pada 14-15 Agustus 2017, bersama Badan Nasional Pengelola Perbatasan (BNPP), Biro Pusat Statistik (BPS), Dinas Pariwisata Daerah, Imigrasi, Direktorat Jenderal Anggaran Kemenkeu, dan pihak Kepolisian.\n\nDeputi Pengembangan Pemasaran Pariwisata Mancanegara, I Gde Pitana, dan Deputi Pengembangan Pemasaran Pariwisata Nusantara, Esthy Reko Astuti, ikut mengawal agenda Rakor Crossborder. Keduanya ditemani 1 Kepala Biro, 11 Asisten Deputi, serta 21 Bidang dan Peneliti.\n\nNarasumber yang diundang juga orang-orang penting di wilayah perbatasan. Mulai dari F. Gatot Yanrianto, Asdep Potensi Perbatasan Laut BNPP, Kombes (Pol) Hari Prasodjo, Analis Kebijakan Sops Polri, Luki Zaiman Prawira, Kepala Dinas Pariwisata Kabupaten Bintan, Heny Wulandari, Biro Pusat Statistik dan Adhar, Kepala Subdirektorat Pengelolaan Data dan pelaporan Imigrasi, hingga Wirawan Setiaji, Analisis Penganggaran Direktorat Anggaran I Kemenkeu, ikut diundang membahas semua persoalan crossborder.\n\nDi crossborder area, 8 Dinas Pariwisata Provinsi Perbatasan juga ikut hadir. Begitu juga 31 Dinas Pariwisata Kabupaten/Kota di wilayah perbatasan. Selain itu, ada pula Kadispar Provinsi Bali, Kadispar Kota Denpasar, ASITA, BPPD Bali, STP Bali, Kajian S2 Pariwisata, Universitas Udayana, serta Ketua Yayasan Desa Adat Sanur.\n\nCrossborder Tourism dinilai strategis untuk menciptakan kantung-kantung destinasi baru yang digerakkan melalui event. Wajar, jika tren jumlah kunjungan wisatawan mancanegara (wisman) via crossborder terus meningkat.\n\n"Pesan Pak Presiden Jokowi adalah menghidupkan ekonomi di daerah tertinggal, terluar, dan perbatasan, yang selama 72 tahun Indonesia merdeka ini belum banyak tersentuh," kata Arief.\n\nPariwisata, lanjut dia, bisa menjadi jembatan untuk mengembangkan perekonomian masyarakat. Benchmarking-nya pun ada. Eropa misalnya. Kunjungan wisman ke Paris bisa menembus 60 juta, Madrid 50 juta, dan London 40 juta dalam setahun.\n\nMayoritas wisman berasal dari crossborder area. Kalau Eropa kejauhan, contoh di Asia Tenggara juga ada.\n\n“Singapura 15 juta, Malaysia 25 juta, dan Thailand 30 juta. Salah satu sumbangan adalah dari borderland tourism jalur darat. Tidak tergantung pada flight lagi," ujar Arief.\n\nDeputi Pengembangan Pemasaran Pariwisata Mancanegara Kemenpar, I Gde Pitana, juga punya pandangan yang sama. Memperkuat crossborder tourism, baginya, adalah salah satu solusi untuk menambah kunjungan wisman ke Indonesia.\n\n"Pada 2016 kita bisa dapatkan 2 juta wisatawan dari wilayah-wilayah perbatasan. Untuk 2017 targetnya naik menjadi 2,5 juta wisman. Pada 2018 targetnya naik lagi menjadi 3.146.000,” ucap Pitana.\n\nMenurutnya, target itu sangat mungkin bisa dicapai. Hitungan kasarnya sudah dirancang. Sudah ada 217 even yang disiapkan di borderland area. Kepri yang punya Batam –Bintan masih menjadi mesin penyumbang tertinggi. Melalui 110 kegiatan, Batam – Bintan diproyeksikan mampu mendulang 2.187.000 wisman. Setelah itu disusul Nusa tenggara Timur (NTT) di empat wilayah dengan 35 even. Dari situ, ada 399.000 wisman yang dibidik berlibur ke Indonesia.\n\nSementara itu, di lima wilayah Papua, ada 12 even yang disiapkan. Proyeksinya, ada 169.000 wisman yang datang via Papua. Kalimantan Barat (Kalbar) lain lagi. Di lima wilayah Kalbar, ada 28 even yang sudah disiapkan. Target yang dibidik, 155.000 wisman. Setelah itu ada Riau. Empat wilayah di Bumi Lancang Kuning itu punya 22 even di wilayah crossborder. Target yang dibidik, 139.000 wisman.\n\nKalimantan Utara (Kaltara) yang punya dua wilayah perbatasan, mengadakan tiga even kegiatan. Target yang dibidik dari sana jumlahnya mencapai 82.000 wisman. Sementara Sulawesi Utara yang punya tiga wilayah perbatasan, sudah menyiapkan tujuh even kegiatan. Target yang dibidik dari sana, 13.000 wisman. Terakhir adalah Kalimantan Timur (Kaltim). Satu wilayah di sana dipatok mampu mendatangkan 2.000 kunjungan wisman.\n\n“Ini bisa dicapai lewat festival musik, budaya, wisata kuliner dan belanja, dan sport tourism. Saya ingin border tourism Indonesia bisa seperti Belanda. Negeri Kincir Angin itu sukses mendatangkan 18 juta wisatawan. Sebanyak 13 juta di antaranya berasal dari negara tetangganya seperti Jerman, Belgia, dan Perancis. Semuanya datang lewat darat,” kata Pitana.\n\nDeputi Pengembangan Pemasaran Pariwisata Nusantara Kemenpar, Esthy Reko Astuti, juga memiliki pandangan sama. Potensi wilayah perbatasan Indonesia dinilai sangat kuat.

But, compared to that of 2016, the total number of Cambodian travelers coming to the archipelago saw a slight increase.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Indonesian Tourism Ministry`s Deputy Assistant for Marketing Development Region I, Masruroh, the total number of Cambodians traveling to Indonesia increased from five thousand people in 2016 to six thousand people in 2017, while there were 49 thousand Indonesians visiting Cambodia in 2017.\n\n\n\nInstead, the number of Indonesians traveling to the country increase around 10 percent compared to that of 2016, which was recorded at 48 thousand people, she noted, adding that the unavailability of direct flights connecting Cambodia and Indonesia`s important cities is a serious challenge for the two countries` tourism industry.\n\n\n\nDue to its small contribution, the Cambodian holidaymakers are not yet given a special attention though the people of Indonesia and Cambodia share many similarities in cultural roots and legacies. In terms of temples, for instance, Indonesia even has lots of bigger temples than those in Cambodia, she added.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the cultural and religious similarities, the Cambodian tourists also love shopping, such as buying traditional goods, including souvenirs. In meeting this need, Indonesia has lots of shopping malls that could be offered to them.\n\n\n\n"Another potential, but challenging, market is selfie tourism, because many Cambodian millennial travelers love selfies," she remarked.\n\n\n\nBy considering this potential, if Indonesia works harder, it would be able to lure more Cambodian tourists coming to the archipelago because it has a lot more tourist destinations other than temples that can be offered to Cambodians, she explained.\n\n\n\nIn dealing with this problem, the Indonesian Government offers incentives to airline companies, which are willing to serve the direct flights to lure more foreign tourist arrivals in the two ASEAN member countries.\n\n\n\n"We keep on attempting to open the direct flights by collaborating with airline companies," Masruroh noted on the sidelines of the Cambodian Travel Mart taking place in Phnom Penh on Friday evening.\n\n\n\nFor the airline companies wanting to provide the direct flights, the government would even offer them cash incentives and joint promotions. The direct flights can be in the forms of regular services and charter flights.\n\n\n\nIndonesia has also learnt about a possibility of making Singapore be a hub, because the city-state had received lots of Cambodian tourists."\n\n\n\nWhat Indonesia can do to attract tourists is to offer several affordable tourist destinations, including the islands of Batam and Bintan, to the Cambodian tourists while staying in Singapore.\n\n\n\nActually, as Masruroh revealed, a small number of Cambodian travelers had visited Bintan and even Jakarta from Singapore thanks to the two countries` direct flights and ferry services.\n\n\n\nMaking Singapore be the hub for helping increase the foreign tourist arrivals in Indonesia, including those of Cambodia, is logic. In its tourism promotion strategy, this neighboring country remains prioritized.\n\n\n\nThe significance of Singapore`s position in the map of Indonesia`s tourism sector has even been recognized by Tourism Minister Arief Yahya mainly due to the city-state`s status as a hub that bridges the East and West, the North and South, and the Southeast and Northeast.\n\n\n\n"Indonesia itself has numerous competitive and comparative advantages for attracting Singaporeans and foreign nationals visiting the country, including its short distance, short flight time, the availability of many entrance gates (including the ones in Batam - Bintan Islands), and its cultural and natural richness."\n\n\n\n"Therefore, a pro-active and sustainable promotion in this targeted market is so indispensable," Yahya elaborated in a press statement.\n\n\n\nCompared to Cambodia, Singapore is obviously a giant with more than 1.5 million tourists visiting Indonesia thanks to the two countries` geographical proximity, and the fact that many of Singaporean citizens love Indonesia`s cultural and natural richness.\n\n\n\nApart from the importance of tourism industry from the economic perspective, this sector also contributes to the collective efforts of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to strengthen the spirit of ASEAN as one community.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism has been suggested to encourage promotion of the Wonderful Indonesia brand in the Southeast Asian region though countries such as Cambodia still have insignificant contribution to the archipelago`s foreign tourist arrivals.\n\n\n\nEDITED BY INE/H-YH\n\n\n\n'),

Hence, hotels and other supporting tourism facilities in Southeast Sulawesi must be improved for them," Sidehabi noted.\n\n\n\nWith Bokori Island and Wakatobi as the mainstay marine tourist destinations, Southeast Sulawesi has several historical and cultural attractions, arts, culinary delicacies, and environmental tourism to offer to visitors.\n\n\n\nWith its scenic beauty, warm waters, and white sandy beaches, Bokori Island is an ideal getaway in Southeast Sulawesi Province for tourists and local residents to unwind.\n\n\n\nSoutheast Sulawesi Tourism and Creative Economy Office Chief Zainal Koedoes remarked that the government had allocated a significant amount of funds, through state and local budgets, to develop the tourism sector of Bokori Islands.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Koedoes said the Southeast Sulawesi provincial government was offering investment opportunities to anyone keen on investing in the tourism sector on Bokori Island.\n\n\n\n"We are offering broader opportunities to anyone keen to invest in developing tourism on Bokori Island," he had remarked in Kendari some time ago.\n\n\n\nKoedoes said the local government, as the facilitator, will prepare initial facilities for investors to boost the economy of the island.\n\n\n\nFurther, he reiterated that the opportunity was wide open for investors keen on developing the tourism sector and creative economy in Bokori Island, which is situated in the district of Konawe.\n\n\n\nHe admitted that Bokori Island was a tourist destination in the region located administratively in Konawe.\n\n\n\n"Bokori Island is beautiful and serves as one of the main tourist destinations after Wakatobi in Southeast Sulawesi," Koedoes remarked.\n\n\n\nAccording to Koedoes, the Departments of Tourism, Public Works, Transportation, Forestry, Food Security, and Marine and Fisheries are working together to develop Bokori Island into a tourist destination in the province.\n\n\n\n"There are already 11 cottages, a meeting hall, and gazebo on the island, and this year, we want to increase the number of such facilities," Koedoes remarked.\n\n\n\nSoutheast Sulawesi Governor Nur Alam affirmed that Bokori Island will continue to be promoted as a tourist destination in the province.\n\n\n\nCovered by natural forests and extensive plantations of teak and ironwood, vast swathes of the Southeast Sulawesi Province are ideal for visitors who prefer challenging adventures and ecotourism.\n\n\n\nIn addition, there are several diving and snorkeling spots around the province, such as at Tolitoli, Hari Island, Baubau, Labengki Island, and Wakatobi Marine National Park.\n\n\n\nThe Wakatobi National Park has a total area spanning 1.39 million hectares. It ranks as one of the highest priorities in marine conservation in Indonesia owing to the scale and condition of its marine biodiversity.\n\n\n\nHence, the government of Wakatobi District in Southeast Sulawesi is inviting both local and foreign investors to invest in the districts tourism sector.\n\n\n\nDriven largely by the districts unique historical, cultural, and natural attractions, Wakatobis tourism sector will continue to grow at a promising rate in the years to come.\n\n\n\nThe Ministry of Tourism is tasked with developing the industry through its implementing agency -- the Wakatobi District Office of Creative Economy and Tourism -- which is responsible for developing and promoting the local tourism sector.\n\n\n\nIndicators showing the growth of the tourism sector underscore the need for accommodation and other facilities to service the growing number of visitors to Wakatobi.\n\n\n\nThe local Creative Economy and Tourism Office Chief Nadar is currently calling for investment in hotel accommodations and visitor facilities in Wakatobi for tourists to enjoy the major attractions across the district.(*)'),

This morning on his official Twitter account, he shared a spectacular photo of a couple’s pre-wedding photo in front of another Indonesian volcano, Mount Sinabung in North Sumatra, and suggested that volcano tourism, done from a safe distance, is something Indonesia needs to develop.\n\nPrewedding dengan latar belakang erupsi Gunung Sinabung.

Volcanic eruption tourism, from a safe distance, has a potential that must be developed.“\n\nMount Sinabung has been spewing hot ash into the atmosphere intermittently since 2010 and has started to become more active recently even while people on the other side of the archipelago await Agung’s eruption.\n\nThe pre-wedding photo shared by Sutopo belongs to Malaysian daredevil photographer Keow Wee Loong and depicts him embracing his wife (then-fiancée) Marta Keow. Besides Indonesia, the couple actually traveled to 10 more countries for Keow to capture their spectacular pre-wedding photo in a variety of dramatic backdrops, including Norway, Japan, Italy, England, Austria, Germany, Poland, Malaysia, Sweden, and Denmark.\n\nThis Photographer Shot His Own Wedding Photo in 11 Countries After Malaysian photographer Keow Wee Loong and his fianc… Posted by Photism Japan on Saturday, June 17, 2017\n\nAlthough his wedding photo in front of Mount Sinabung, taken in May, appears to be well outside of the volcano’s danger zone, Keow did enter the restricted red zone to take these incredible photos of the abandoned ghost towns within the shadow of the volcano.\n\nKeow is famous for his other daring photography projects, including sneaking into Fukushima’s red zone to capture images of the towns abandoned after the nuclear disaster.\n\nhttp://zafigo.com/stories/zafigo-stories/an-interview-with-photographer-keow-wee-long-and-his-fukushima-photos/thanks Mei Mei Chu and James Chong Posted by Keow Wee Loong on Monday, July 11, 2016\n\nDo you think that Sutopo’s suggestion of developing volcano tourism in Indonesia is a good idea, or do you think it might recklessly lead to more thrillseekers being put in harm’s way?

One of my jobs was to get start-up fund.”\n\nKavanagh said the Malaysian and Indonesian teams quickly got down to working together.\n\nDuring the first meeting in Singapore, he said WWF Indonesia corrected a conceptual mistake, that there was too much focus on the protected areas and not the overall context.\n\n“We broadened our focus towards sustainability in the surrounding landscape.”\n\nMeanwhile, Kavanagh said support was growing slowly in the WWF network until, at the suggestion of WWF United States, the Borneo Forest Initiative was rebranded as The Heart of Borneo, or HoB.\n\nHe said WWF Indonesia then initiated a workshop at Putussibau in West Kalimantan, hosted by the regency government.\n\n“First and foremost, there are three countries on Borneo. What about Brunei?”\n\nIn this respect, Kavanagh said three people, namely the Brunei High Commissioner in London, Dato’ Yussof Hamid, WWF Diplomatic Advisor Guilda Navidi-Walker and WWF United Kingdom Conservation Director Francis Sullivan took their own initiative to get Brunei on board.\n\nLater, Stuart Chapman joined the team as the HoB International Coordinator based in Jakarta.\n\n“At this point, the team put a lot of effort into convincing allies and decision-makers on the various values of HoB.”\n\nHe said the pace really picked up from the beginning of 2005.\n\nThis led to the HoB workshop in Brunei held in April 2005 with government representatives from the three countries, WWF, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and scientists, where they drew up a vision statement.\n\nThe vision for the HoB is that partnerships at all levels ensure effective management and conservation of a network of protected areas, productive forests and other sustainable land uses. Borneo’s magnificent heritage is thereby sustained forever.\n\n“The leaders for the governments’ teams at the April 2005 workshop were united in conveying their governments’ support for the initiative.”\n\nThanks to former Malaysian Prime Minister Tun Abdullah Badawi, Kavanagh said the ASEAN heads of government accepted the importance of conserving the forests and other natural resources of the HoB at their summit in Kuala Lumpur, December 2005.\n\nHoB was accepted as a flagship programme of the Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines – East Asean Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) at the same summit.\n\nOn February 12, 2007, the ministers responsible for forestry in Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia signed the landmark declaration on the HoB Initiative in Bali.\n\nKavanagh arrived in Malaysia in 1978 to coordinate the Malaysian Primates Research Programme for Cambridge University with Universiti Pertanian Malaysia and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.\n\nHe then spent 25 years with WWF Malaysia, starting with assisting Sarawak Forest Department to establish new protected areas, and later 16 years as national CEO through 2006.\n\nIn 2000, Kavanagh proposed that WWF explored the idea of creating transboundary protected areas along the Indonesia/Malaysia border, with Brunei joining in later that eventually became HoB.'),

Unsurprisingly, Bali’s tourism sector has been particularly damaged by the volcano, suffering losses of about Rp264 billion (£14million) alone. However, it is the island’s banking industry that is expected to bear the brunt of the losses, according to Purwo Nugroho of Bali’s Disaster Mitigation Agency. He explained that Balinese locals have lost jobs and income and will no longer be able to repay their debts, costing banks in the region of Rp1.05 trillion (£61 million).\n\nBali officials downgraded Mount Agung’s alert status to level three yesterday (October 29), after a sustained drop in seismic activity beneath the volcano - a move that will be welcomed by hotel owners on the island. Despite the reduction, Bali’s Volcanology Centre (PVMBG) has warned that the threat of an eruption has not yet passed. “The volcanic activities have not completely calmed down and there is still a potential for an eruption,” a spokesperson said.

Coast Economic Region (ECER) Implementation and Coordination Committee (ICC) meeting. — File picture by Yusof Mat Isa\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, Oct 29 — People in Kelantan will continue to benefit from the increased socio-economic opportunities in the state, following a number of high-impact public projects implemented by the East Coast Economic Region Development Council (ECERDC), particularly in tourism, cross-border trade and the small and medium enterprise (SME) sectors.\n\n“The Federal Government through ECERDC has been working closely with the state government to implement various projects and human capital development programmes to spur the socio-economic growth in Kelantan.\n\n“Private investments and ongoing developments in Kelantan have shown positive impact for the rakyat by creating more than 22,860 jobs and 6,360 entrepreneurial opportunities,” said ECERDC Chief Executive Officer Datuk Seri Jebasingam Issace John in a statement after the East Coast Economic Region (ECER) Implementation and Coordination Committee (ICC) Kelantan meeting here today.\n\nThe ICC meeting was chaired by Kelantan Menteri Besar Datuk Ahmad Yakob.\n\nOne of the key high-impact projects included the construction of the Plaza IMT-GT (Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle) in Bukit Bunga, expected to commence operations in November.\n\nStrategically located along the borders of Rantau Panjang-Sungai Golok and Pengkalan Kubor-Tak Bai, the project was anticipated to further boost cross-border trade, tourism and commercial industrial development in the area.\n\nThe Plaza would provide close to 100 local entrepreneurs the opportunity to promote and market their products, including to foreign buyers, from neighbouring country, Thailand.\n\nMeanwhile, Kampung Laut, a village in Sungai Kelantan, Tumpat, was set to undergo development as a “Kampung Warisan” beginning February 2018.\n\nThe effort, part of ECERDC’s overall strategy to boost and strengthen the tourism sector in the region, would open up greater entrepreneurial opportunities for the villagers, as more tourists are expected to visit the area in search for Kampung Laut’s unique handicraft and delicacies, such as wau, batik, serunding and dodol.\n\nExpected to be fully completed by 2020, the project would benefit more than 30 entrepreneurs in the area.\n\nBetween 2007 and September 2017, Kelantan successfully secured RM12.7 billion in domestic and foreign investments, driven mainly by the manufacturing sector which contributed 56.8 per cent, followed by the logistics sector (16.5 per cent) and real estate (12.7 per cent).\n\nJebasingam said private investment was expected to grow further, leveraging on Kelantan’s potential as a regional halal hub.\n\nThe Pasir Mas Halal Park (PMHP), one of the key industrial parks established by ECERDC, has recorded encouraging response from investors with phase one fully taken up.\n\nAt present, work has already begun on phase two to accommodate growing demand.\n\nPMHP was expected to attract RM611 million in private investment and create more than 4,200 job opportunities by 2020.\n\nAmong other completed projects included the Tok Bali Integrated Fisheries Park in Pasir Puteh, as well as, the Collection, Processing and Packaging Centre in Pengkalan Kubor — both of which are key in developing Kelantan as the hub for fish and marine-based activities.\n\nBumiputera entrepreneurs, who have contributed 36 per cent of the state’s total investments to date, were another key contributor to employment and entrepreneurial opportunities in Kelantan.\n\nBetween 2012 and September 2017, a total of 45 Bumiputera companies, worth RM4.6 billion, have received incentives from either ECERDC or [email protected] or both, which in turn would create 6,044 potential jobs.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dana Mudahcara [email protected] approved RM87.3 million to 35 recipients in the state, involving investments of up to RM728.1 million, thus cementing the positive impact brought about by Bumiputera entrepreneurs to Kelantan’s economic growth.\n\n“The Federal Government’s focus on enhancing connectivity is expected to boost investment opportunities in the state.\n\n“The East Coast Rail Link (ECRL), which has begun construction in Tunjong, will act as a game-changer to the socio-economic landscape of Kelantan as will it open up new growth centres, as well as, create new jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities for the locals,” he said.\n\nThis 600km project, connecting key industrial development areas including Tok Bali, Jelawat, Kota Bharu and Wakaf Bharu in Kelantan, would enhance market competitiveness for businesses and open more career opportunities for the people of Kelantan.\n\n“We are working towards reviewing our current strategy for the ECER including Kelantan which will be unveiled soon. We strongly believe Kelantan is well placed to further propel its socio-economic growth as the state is strategically positioned for cross-border trade, supported by the growing tourism, logistics and trade facilitation sectors,” Jebasingam added. — Bernama'),

The move is expected to boost revenue from tourism and create jobs.A high-level taskforce chaired by the shipping secretary is in advanced discussions with cruise terminal management and construction companies including Singapore-based SATS-Creuers Cruise Services and London-based PSA to start operations from India, a senior government official told ET on condition of anonymity because the proposal is yet to be finalised.“The tenders for the same would be floated soon,” the official said, adding that the shipping ministry has roped in Miami-based consulting firm Bermello Ajamil & Partners along with EY to draw up a plan for the development of cruise tourism.The ministry will invest Rs 1,500 crore to set up five cruise terminals in the country, one each in Mumbai, Goa, Chennai, Cochin and near Kandla port.Another top official in the tourism ministry confirmed that work is in advanced stages and the government will finalise incentives to be offered to attract international companies to set up base in India.“These could include extending the facility of e-visa at ports, giving tax concessions , creating ports of international standards and setting up dedicated berths at select ports for cruise liners,” the official added, requesting not to be identified. According to the second official, there is no international cruise starting from India and Indians craving for a holiday at sea must first travel to Singapore or Thailand to take up one.“Consequently, they lose time in going to Singapore or Thailand and shell out extra for air tickets,” the official said.“The rollout of international cruises from India will give a big boost to tourism and would also open doors to big Indian weddings on cruises, besides creating more jobs,” the official said, adding that over the years, cruise tourism could become one of the major revenue generators for the country.The cruise tourism sector is estimated to have a revenue potential of close to Rs 35,000 crore and is expected to create over 250,000 jobs, shipping and road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari had said in August.Demand for cruise tourism increased 62% between 2005 and 2015, with more than 25 million such passengers likely by the end of this year, according to Cruise Lines International Association .

Sekitar 300 delegasi ASITA dari seluruh Indonesia yang hadir itu serius menyimak pemaparan Menpar Arief Yahya terkait digital tourism.\n\nDi tengah timbulnya disruption di banyak industri, Menpar Arief Yahya menyebut 3T yakni Telecommunication, Transportation, serta yang sedang dan akan terjadi, di Tourism. Kata-kata tourism inilah yang membuat audience menahan napas. Sebab industri pariwisata, cepat atau lambat akan menghadapi perubahan yang revolusioner, mau tidak mau, suka tidak suka, industri pariwisata harus mengikuti perubahan konsumen.\n\n“Revolusi teknologi digital ini tidak bisa dihindari, pasti terjadi! Pasti. Secara alamiah akan mengubah dunia, menciptakan model bisnis baru, jadi pelaku industri yang tidak mau berubah dengan platform digital, pasti akan ditinggalkan customer,” jelas Menpar Arief Yahya saat Gala Dinner menjelang Rakernas II ASITA, Jumat (10/11) malam.\n\nMenpar Arief Yahya mencontohkan di transportasi terjadi ketika bertemu dengan bisnis digital, seperti Grab, Gojek dan Uber. Dengan munculnya digital transportation, harga pasar langsung berubah total, harga turun drastis. Begitupun di telekomunikasi, semakin murah, semakin gratis, akan semakin untung. Oleh karena itu WhatsApp (WA), Google, Baidu, Line mengirimkan pesan gratis, tidak berbayar.\n\nSementara, revolusi ketiga adalah tourism. Ini yang paling diwanti-wanti Menpar Arief Yahya agar industri pariwisata Indonesia waspada. Menurutnya, bila travel agent tidak bisa mengikuti perubahan zaman, dikhawatirkan akan bernasib sama seperti warung telekomunikasi (wartel), terbunuh dengan sendirinya. Travel agent konvensional akan sulit bersaing dengan online travel agent, seperti Traveloka, Booking.com, TripAdvisor, Ctrip, dan lainnya.\n\n“Mereka para online travel agent ini melakukan sharing economi, mengoptimalkan kapasitas, menjual yang kosong dengan harga murah dan mencari return dari cross selling. Ini semua bisa berjalan dengan cara digital. Bila travel agent masih berharap pada transaksi dengan pertemuan, ini pasti akan bernasib sama seperti wartel yang mati dengan munculnya selullar,” jelas Menpar Arief Yahya.\n\nMenpar mengakui, revolusi ini pasti ada resistensi dari incumbent (travel agent konvensional). Namun Menteri Arief meyakinkan hal ini akan terjadi karena pengalamannya selama puluhan tahun menggeluti dunia telekomunikasi, termasuk saat menjadi Direktur Utama PT Telkom.\n\n"Saya tidak asal ngomong, contohnya saat di Telkom, bila saat itu kami tidak masuk ke lini selular, Telkom akan habis. Karena sudah menjadi kepastian masyarakat atau customer Telkom akan mematikan telpon rumahnya dan beralih ke ponsel. Begitu juga dengan tourism, turis sudah mencapai 70 persen melakukan search and share via online," tutur pria asal Banyuwangi ini.\n\nDi acara yang digelar tiga hari 10-12 November 2017 ini, Menpar Arief Yahya juga menyampaikan perubahan kinerja dalam organisasi Kementerian Pariwisata RI yang bergerak semakin cepat dan berorientasi ke arah program digital tourism.\n\nDalam presentasinya, Menpar Arief menjelaskan bahwa salah satu rahasia mengapa growth wisatawan mancanegara (wisman) Indonesia termasuk 20 besar dunia, atau naik hingga 25 persen. Padahal regional ASEAN dan dunia hanya naik rata-rata enam persen. Dia mengaku semua disebabkan digital tourism yang diterapkannya.\n\n“Karena kami semakin digital. Dari soal penggunaan Social Media, Big Data, E-Commerce (Look, Book, Pay), dan krusialnya digitalisasi untuk mendekatkan diri kepada konsumen,” kata Menpar Arief Yahya.\n\nKetua Dewan Pemimpin Pusat (DPP) ASITA Indonesia, Asnawi Bahar mengakui apa yang disampaikan Menpar Arief Yahya benar adanya. Sebab itu, kata dia, ASITA pun sudah mempersiapkan diri untuk terus beradaptasi mengikiti perubahan yang menuju digital tourism untuk tetap bisa memberikan kontribusi kedatangan wisman yang ditargetkan pemerintah.\n\n"ASITA menyadari betul apa yang disampaikan Pak Menteri memang sedang terjadi. Karena itu ASITA juga menyiapkan aplikasi-aplikasi yang bisa digunakan para anggotanya untuk bisa turut bersaing di era digital tourism sekarang ini," ujar Asnawi.\n\nAsnawi menegaskan, salah satu yang menjadi pokok pembahasan dalam Rakernas II ASITA ini, adalah mematangkan aplikasi-aplikasi yang bisa digunakan anggotanya yang 90 persen adalah Usaha Mikro Kecil Menengah (UMKM).\n\n"Ini untuk menjawab tantangan yang datang kepada ASITA, sehingga kami terus mendorong digitalisasi kepada anggotanya. Karena kami menyadari tidak bisa menolak keadaan ini sehingga mau tidak mau, suka tidak suka, kami akan berada di tengah-tengah keadaan ini. Ini harus kita jalani agar bisa tetap bersaing," kata Asnawi.\n\nKarena alasan itulah, lanjut Asnawi, Rakernas kali ini sengaja digelar di Jawa Timur. Dia menjelaskan, salah satu pemimpin daerah di Jawa Timur, yakni Banyuwangi, telah berhasil menerapkan digital tourism yang didengungkan Kementerian Pariwisata.\n\n"Tidak dimungkuri bahwa Banyuwangi adalah daerah yang berhasil memajukan sektor pariwisatanya paling pesat di Indonesia. Semua karena pemimpinnya berhasil menjadi CEO yang bisa menerapkan dan menjawab tantangan perubahan zaman. Semua juga karena sinergi yang bagus dengan Menteri Pariwisata. Karena itu kami sepakat menjadikan Banyuwangi sebagai motivasi dalam memajukan pariwisata di daerah lainnya," ungkap Asnawi.\n\nDalam Rakernas II ASITA ini, juga disepakati mempromosikan destinasi wisata yang ada di Jawa Timur baik yang sudah tersohor ataupun belum dikenal. Konsep Rakernas II inimengambil tema Fun Business, Explore the beauty of Mount Bromo, dan Effective & Efficient B2B (Business to Business) Forum.\n\n"Rakernas II dihadiri perwakilan DPD Asita di seluruh Indonesia ada 33 DPD. Juga ada Bromo Tengger Semeru Travel Mart Jatim juga yang mempertemukan buyer dan seller dalam sebuah forum B2B dan B2C," kata Asnawi.\n\nAsnawi menjelaskan, dalam pertemuan bisnis tertutup antara buyer dan seller berlangsung dalam satu hari. Para seller berasal dari agen wisata, hotel, penyelenggara MICE, tempat wisata dan atraksi wisata sebanyak dari 30 kota/kabupaten di Jawa Timur.\n\n"Sementara buyer adalah agen-agen travel dari Indonesia dan berbagai negara di dunia yang ingin menjual paket tur wisata Jawa Timur (inbound). Ada juga pandangan berbeda pada table top antara sektor wisata dan sektor industri. Pada sektor industri, buyer adalah importir produk-produk Indonesia," pungkas Asnawi.'),

It will change the world, creating new business model, so business people who don’t want to switch into digital platform will be left by the customers,” told Arief.\n\nHe explained that digital technology has changed the transportation industry as evidenced by the rise of online public transportation companies such as Grab and Uber that have managed to reduce the transportation fee.\n\nThe same thing in the telecommunication industry, the service is also getting cheaper with the availability of chat applications such as WhatsApp, Google, Baidu, Line that allow users to send messages for free.\n\nThe third revolution is in the tourism industry where online travel agents such as Traveloka, Booking.com, TripAdvisor, Ctrip and others have disrupted conventional travel agents.\n\nRead also: Five travel trends to watch in 2018\n\n“These online travel agents practice sharing economy and capacity optimization by selling someone else’s assets in cheaper price and gaining return from cross selling.

We knew that Telkom customers would switch to cell phone. The same thing is happening in the tourism [industry]; 70 percent of tourists do their research online,” Arief told.\n\nIn his presentation, Arief also talked about how the growth of foreign tourists coming to Indonesia could increase up to 25 percent, making it among the top 20 worldwide list, while the average worldwide growth was at six percent.\n\n“It\'s because we are becoming more digital, from the utilization of social media, big data, e-commerce and digital approach to customers,” told Arief.\n\nASITA Indonesia DPP head Asnawi Bahar nodded in agreement to Arief’s explanation, as currently ASITA is preparing themselves for digital tourism.\n\n“ASITA fully acknowledges that has been told by the ministry is currently happening, hence we are preparing applications that members can use in order to compete in the era of digital tourism,” said Asnawi.\n\nThe Rakernas II discussed three topics: Fun Business, Explore the Beauty of Mount Bromo and Effective and Efficient B2B Forum.

Other speakers will include economic observer Faisal Basri, Senior Vice-President, Government and Industry Affairs of the World Travel and Tourism Council Helen Marano, and TripAdvisors Head of Destination Marketing APAC Sarah Mathew.\n\n\n\nIn his address, during a presentation highlighting the three-year term of the government of Jokowi and Vice President Jusuf Kalla, on Oct 17, 2017, Minister Yahya remarked that based on the World Banks research, the tourism sector has become the core business in Indonesia, as it has largely contributed to the countrys gross domestic product and foreign exchange was well as created job opportunities.\n\n\n\nThe tourism sector is projected to generate the highest foreign exchange earnings in 2019, reaching US$24 billion, surpassing those generated from the oil and gas and crude palm oil sectors.\n\n\n\n"In 2019, the tourism sector is projected to generate most of the countrys foreign exchange, higher than the oil and gas, coal, and palm oil sectors. It is the largest at both the regional and global levels," he noted during a discussion session held at the Presidential Staff Offices in Jakarta.\n\n\n\nForeign exchange earnings from the tourism sector occupied the fourth position, after the oil and gas, coal, and palm oil sectors during the period between 2013 and 2015, but last year, it had moved to the second place, following palm oil, with $13.5 billion.\n\n\n\nHe pointed out that Thailand was Indonesias main competitor nation in the tourism sector, as its foreign exchange earnings in the sector exceeded Indonesias figure by $40 billion.(*)'),

With a country made up of more than 17,000 islands spread over 5,000km, there’s no avoiding having to take internal flights to get between destinations. A good idea is to use Bali as your base, spending a few days there before exploring some of the more remote areas. We headed to Kalimantan first, the Indonesian half of Borneo, flying in to Pangkalan Bun. From here, we boarded a klotok (traditional riverboat) and headed up the Sekonyer River into Tanjung Puting National Park in the hope of spotting its most protected inhabitant, the orang-utan. Borneo and Sumatra are the only two places in the world where you can see them in the wild, and Tanjung Puting is home to one of the biggest populations. There are three feeding platforms along the river, set deep in the rainforest and built so that researchers can monitor rehabilitated animals. It’s at these points that tourists can catch sight of the great apes as they emerge from the trees to stock up on bananas.\n\nWe all stood silently transfixed as several mothers with clinging babies enjoyed their snacks. Observing their mannerisms, it’s easy to see why orang-utan means “man of the forest” in Indonesian – they even share 97 per cent of their DNA with humans. Sailing peacefully back down the river, we also spotted gibbons, noisy proboscis monkeys and a host of exotic bird life. We crammed this into one day, but to fully explore the river it’s recommended to spend two or three days on board, sleeping on the covered deck. The klotoks are basic but have all you need, including a cook who’ll whip up simple but tasty meals of fresh fish, noodles and rice.\n\nGETTY The views from Padar Island of three bays curving into the land are amazing\n\nWhen it was time for dinner we dropped anchor under a tree lit up by fireflies, then afterwards drifted back to port, lying on deck and gazing up at the stars, savouring this incredible experience. After a quick stopover in Bali, we were in the air again to our next destination, the small fishing town of Labuan Bajo on the island of Flores, and the gateway to the Komodo National Park, to see real-life dragons. Spend a day exploring the town itself, full of waterside bars, ancient caves and beautiful harbour views. One of the best meals I ate all week was at the Kampung Ujung local fish market, where we messily tucked into plates of fresh crab and grilled fish for about 100,000 rupiah (sounds extortionate but it’s only about £6). For a more refined experience, head to Atlantis Beach Club to watch the sun go down, cocktail in hand. Early the next morning we hit the water in a wooden sail boat to explore the outlying islands. Like Tanjung Puting, we did this in a day, but a couple of nights spent out on the water will really make the most of these stunning sites. First we stopped off at Padar Island where a steep, sweaty hike to the top rewarded us with the most incredible view of three bays curving into the land, each with different coloured sand (white, black and pale pink, created by tiny particles of red coral mixed in with the sand).\n\nGETTY Hop on a traditional boat on the Sekonyer River to see Orangutans and the Komodo dragon\n\nBest in Travel 2018: Top 10 best value destinations to visit Tue, October 24, 2017 The world’s leading travel authority reveals its selection of the top ten best value destinations that Lonely Planet’s experts recommend travellers experience in 2018 Play slideshow JekLi/Shutterstock 1 of 10 10: Hunan, China - The mind-blowing scenery of Zhangjiajie Forest Park in Hunan, China\n\nIf you’re lucky you might spot a Komodo dragon on Padar, but your best chances are on their namesake island nearby. As many as 1,300 of the giant lizards live on Komodo, often found basking by the water hole or outside the rangers’ kitchens where they’re drawn to the smells. The ones we spotted seemed rather docile, but the two rangers escorting us armed with large sticks left us in no doubt that the 10ft-long, prehistoric-looking creatures were not to be messed with. To finish off the day – and our week – we dropped anchor at another pink beach on Rinca Island to snorkel above some of the world’s best coral reefs.

The tourist resort province of Bali has so far contributed to more than 40 percent of the country`s foreign tourist arrivals.\n\n\n\nBali, last year, contributed some 4.92 million foreign tourists to the country`s total foreign tourists arrivals of 12.02 million. Therefore, Mount Gunung Agung eruption had a significant impact on the reduction in the number of visitors.\n\n\n\n"Possibly, we can also reach 14 million. Up to September, the arrivals of foreign tourists were still okay. It was encouraging, but due to the eruption, we cannot do anything," Tourism Minister Arief Yahya was quoted as saying by Kompas.com on the sidelines of his visit to Sabang City, Aceh, on Nov 30.\n\n\n\nAccording to the minister, the eruption of Gunung Agung is one of the causes of the failure to achieve the target. "Before the eruption, we were confident of achieving the 15 million target," Yahya added. He predicted that the closure of Bali`s Ngurah Rai Airport for one day, for example, affected the entry of about 15 thousand foreign tourist to Bali.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the minister urged all players in the industry in Bali to provide support or facilities needed by tourists in the island in connection with the eruption of Mount Agung. The minister noted that visitors would certainly be impressed if Bali could provide good services during the time of disaster.\n\n\n\nThe impact would be good for the future. Travelers would be impressed by the services, and Bali would have a good reputation among tourists across the world.\n\n\n\nEven though Mount Agung has disturbed foreign tourist arrivals, the minister is still optimistic that the country will still be able to record 14 million visitors, or two million higher than the arrivals in 2016.\n\n\n\nAfter all, the arrivals in the country in the first 10 months this year still grew by 24 percent.\n\n\n\n"The figure puts Indonesia among the top 20 countries with the highest tourism growth," the minister noted.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, tourist arrivals in Malaysia grew 0.87 percent in the January-May 2017 period, while that of Singapore and Thailand grew by 3.83 percent in the January-July 2017 period and 6.69 percent in the January-October 2017 period, respectively.\n\n\n\nIn the Southeast Asian region, Indonesia was second only to Vietnam, which recorded 25.2 percent between January and November 2017. "Indonesia`s tourism growth of 24 percent is well above the ASEAN tourism growth of 7 percent and the world tourism growth of 6.4 percent. It (the 24 percent tourism growth) has shored up our confidence to achieve the target of tourist arrivals at 17 million for 2018," he remarked.\n\n\n\nHe expressed hope that the tourism industry in Bali will soon recover following the eruption of Mount Agung. The Bali tourism industry contributes nearly 40 percent of tourist arrivals in the country.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, the number of foreign tourists visiting Indonesia is predicted to increase in 2018 with improving economy of big tourist markets of China, India, Japan and South Korea.\n\n\n\n"The economic condition of a country would determine the number of people holidaying abroad," Deputy for Development and Marketing of Foreign Tourism at the Tourism Ministry I Gde Pitana said speaking at a meeting on "Sales and Marketing Summit 2017" in Bali on Friday (Nov 24).\n\n\n\nPitana said his office would optimize tourism promotion both through conventional marketing and through using information technology and networks promotion. The tourism ministry hopes to chalk up 17 million visits of foreign tourists in the country in 2018 and 20 million in 2019, he said.\n\n\n\nThe elections which are to be held simultaneously for regional leaders in 2018 would have no significant effect on the number of foreign visitors to the country. "We are not worried by the regional elections. The election would not discouraged visitors to Indonesia," he added.\n\n\n\nOn the contrary the election would contribute to economic growth in the regions with many hotels recording higher occupancy rate and small enterprises enjoying larger turnover.\n\n\n\nPitana acknowledged there was a decline in the visits of foreign tourists to Bali, the country`s largest tourist destination, because of the threat of angry volcano Mount Agung, which frequently spews volcanic matters sending black smokes to the sky lately.\n\n\n\nIn September 2017, the number of visits by foreign tourist to Bali grew 25 percent year-on-year , but in October the growth rate dropped to only 6 percent. "The number continued to grow but slower as many foreign tourists decided to cancel visit to the island on fear of the report of volcanic explosions, although in general the condition in Bali is still normal," he said.\n\n\n\nHowever, promotional activities should continue to convince tourists that it is safe in Bali, he added.\n\n\n\n(A014/INE)\n\nEDITED BY INE\n\n(T.A014/A/KR-BSR/A014)\n\n'),

However, infrastructure bottlenecks make it difficult to tap the potential of this area. Previously, tourists (those living outside Sumatra or abroad) had to fly to Medan, located approximately 170 kilometers to the north of Lake Toba, and then take a bus or car to travel over land for about five hours before reaching Lake Toba. These tough circumstances made many people opt for an easier choice in, for example, Malaysia or Thailand.\n\nHowever, with the presence of Silangit International Airport, tourists can now reach Lake Toba in about 45 minutes from the airport. Hence, it has become much more attractive for domestic and foreign tourists to travel to Indonesia\'s largest lake (and the world\'s largest volcanic lake).\n\nOne of the reasons why Indonesia attracts few foreign tourists compared to Malaysia, Singapore or Malaysia is because traveling across Indonesia is complicated due to infrastructure hurdles. While between 20 and 30 million foreigners visit these three countries each year, Indonesia only managed to welcome 11.5 million foreign tourists in 2016.\n\nOn the positive side, it means there is plenty of room for growth for Indonesia\'s tourism industry, provided infrastructure development continues to progress and local human resources learn the skills (including the English language) so that they can offer good services to the tourist.\n\nAlthough coming from a low base, foreign tourist arrivals in Indonesia are already one of the country\'s key foreign exchange earners. It is estimated that Indonesia can collect up to USD $16 billion in foreign exchange from foreign tourists this year as each tourist spends about USD $1,000 - $1,200 per visit. In the January-September 2017 period, tourist arrivals in Indonesia grew by 17.48 percent year-on-year (y/y) to 8.82 million tourists.\n\nAlthough Silangit International Airport has received the status of international airport and was officially opened by Widodo on Friday, work on the airport has not been completed yet. The length of the runway will be extended from 2,650 meters, currently, to 3,000 meters, while the size of the terminal will be expanded from 3,054 m2 to 10,000 m2. This will make it possible to welcome large-sized airplanes and handle plenty of traffic and air passengers. These targets should be completed by 2020.\n\nThe Indonesian government hopes to see a 30 percent increase in visitors to Lake Toba in the next 12 months. In 2016 a total of 230,000 tourists visited the lake. Starting from 2019 there should be at least one million visitors per year. Visitor growth should also trigger various new economic activities in the area, particularly in the hospitality industry and transportation, hence the welfare of the local communities should rise.\n\nAirlines Garuda Indonesia, Sriwijaya Air, Batik Air and Citilink have all confirmed their Jakarta-Silangit route.

There is a large mosque just off the main road whose last call to prayer at night can be heard through the beat of live reggae bands.\n\nTourists flock to Indonesia from all over the world to enjoy its beaches, wildlife and heritage sites. But many are coming for religious reasons, too. In 2015, Lombok, whose population is 90 percent Muslim, was dubbed the "world\'s best halal tourism destination" at an annual Muslim travel industry event in Dubai. The island — which has long been overshadowed by glamorous, Hindu-majority Bali, just a 30-minute flight to the west — eagerly seized on the distinction as a unique touristic selling point.\n\n"We don\'t have to be the \'Muslim Bali,\'" Muhammad Adi Farchan, a halal tour operator, said in the coastal Lombok town of Senggigi. "We are just Muslim Lombok! Muslim paradise."\n\nIf the phrase "halal tourism" — which came into vogue about a decade ago — seems neologistic, it\'s nevertheless at the cusp of an emerging trend in the travel industry: holidays that don\'t merely accommodate religious Muslims, but actively cater to them. A term most commonly used to describe food provenance, "halal" more broadly means religiously permissible per Muslim law.\n\nAs the world\'s largest Muslim country, Indonesia has pinned hopes on the halal market to expand its $13 billion tourism industry, which lags behind those of neighbors like Thailand and Singapore. Lombok is in West Nusa Tenggara province, which is one of three government-designated "priority" halal destinations, along with West Sumatra and Aceh. Jakarta\'s deputy governor Sandiaga Uno has expressed interest in developing a "sharia tourism zone" in the nation\'s capital, and recently announced that the city would build "sharia-based" hotels.\n\nAbout 2.7 million tourists visited halal destinations in Indonesia in 2016, according to a Tourism Ministry spokesperson, out of about 12 million foreign tourists in total. The greatest increase was seen in Lombok, which the ministry credits to halal tourism.\n\nLombok welcomed about 3 million foreign and domestic tourists last year. On this island, nearly all the food — fish satay, chicken smeared with eponymous Lombok chili sambal — is already halal, and you\'re never more than five minutes from a mosque. Nearly every hotel, restaurant and beach club has a musholla, or prayer room. And since the island\'s population is mostly Muslim, the odds are that a tour guide for any activity — from trekking the volcanic Mount Rinjani to diving with sea turtles — can accommodate religious considerations.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kamran Jebreili/AP Kamran Jebreili/AP\n\n"Indonesia is great to visit because we don\'t have to explain why we want things like prayer rooms and certified halal food," said Omar, a 52-year-old tourist from Saudi Arabia who did not want to use his last name, at the flagship Islamic Center mosque complex in the provincial capital Mataram. "Everyone is Muslim, so they already understand."\n\nSuch travelers could significantly boost Indonesia\'s tourism revenue, officials hope. Visitors from the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia spend more money on average — about $1,500 to $1,700 per person per trip — than other tourists to Indonesia, who spend around $1,200 per person, according to Arief Yahya, Indonesia\'s tourism minister.\n\nBut the number of Middle Eastern and Gulf tourists to all of Indonesia hovered around just 200,000 last year, compared to 600,000 who visited nearby Thailand. To attract more of these lucrative tourists, Indonesia has pushed for more direct flights from Gulf carriers like Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways and reframed its promotion of destinations outside Bali.\n\nThat includes Aceh, a conservative province on Sumatra that\'s perhaps best known for being governed by sharia or Islamic law, which now has slick signs plastered in its airport advertising its appeal as a halal destination. Aceh has miles of unspoiled diving beaches, historic mosques and the Leuser Ecosystem rain forest. But facets of Acehnese life that might deter other visitors, such as the banning of alcohol, can work as selling points for devout Muslim travelers.\n\nThe campaign turns Aceh\'s longtime moniker "Mecca\'s veranda" into a tourism tagline.\n\nThose in the travel industry describe Muslim travelers as the next "billion-person market," after India and China. Almost a quarter of the entire world\'s population is Muslim.\n\n"There are 1.6 Muslims in the world, which means 1.6 billion potential halal travelers," said Fazal Bahardeen, the Sri Lankan-born founder of CrescentRating, a Singapore-based halal travel certification company.\n\nFor three years, Bahardeen\'s company has issued an annual report on global halal tourism in conjunction with MasterCard. The 2017 report, released in May in Jakarta, estimates the number of international Muslim travelers at 121 million, accounting for about 10 percent of the world\'s travel industry.\n\n"Almost 60 percent of them travel to Asia, which makes the continent the key region of growth for halal tourism," said Bahardeen.\n\nBahardeen\'s estimate, based on various countries\' raw tourism data, lines up with a 2015 report on the global Islamic economy by Thomson Reuters, which pegged the global Muslim travel market in 2014 at $142 billion – excluding pilgrimages for the Hajj and Umrah — accounting for about 11 percent of global travel expenditure. That was a 6.3 percent increase over the previous year.\n\nCrescentRating also ranks countries on their suitability for religious Muslim travelers. For the last three years, Malaysia has ranked as the No. 1 country overall for halal holidays. Southeast Asia in general has a strong presence on CrescentRating\'s list, with Indonesia in third place. The United Arab Emirates ranks second.\n\nThe criteria include halal food availability, facilities for the five daily prayers, "water-friendly" bathrooms (some Muslims prefer using bidets or hand-showers to toilet paper, and prefer special taps for wudhu, ritual ablutions before prayer) and accessibility of family-friendly areas away from nightclubs and casinos.\n\nBut non-Muslim nations are getting on board, too. In March, Al Meroz, which bills itself as "Bangkok\'s leading halal hotel," opened its doors in the Thai capital. The luxury hotel, run by an observant Muslim, doesn\'t sell alcohol, offers a female-only floor for women traveling solo, maintains separate male and female hours for its gym and pool and makes sure even its detergents are free of animal fat (pig and pork products are forbidden for observant Muslims).\n\nJapan, which offers visa-free entry to Indonesians and Malaysians, is home to several halal tourism outfits and has had halal restaurants and prayer rooms at Narita International Airport since 2014. One of those restaurants even supplies halal in-flight meals to carriers including Malaysia Airlines; Japan Airlines started serving its own such meals last year.\n\nFood is one of the major sticking points for observant Muslims traveling in non-Muslim countries, said Mikhail Goh, the Singaporean founder of the website Have Halal, Will Travel, whose Facebook page has 157,000 followers.\n\n"Oftentimes, you\'ll find Muslims, especially those from Asia, with their bags packed with food in the event that halal food is not easily available," he said.\n\nGoh\'s website recently released an eponymous app with halal city guides for Seoul, Tokyo and Singapore. "Countries like Japan and Korea are increasingly Muslim-friendly," he said, "but there was a lack of rich information on where to find halal food options or prayer spaces."\n\nThe exact definition of halal differs from country to country – the UAE, for example, requires extensive documentation that products follow sharia and prohibits the sale of pork products to Muslims, whereas Indonesia still does not have a federal halal certification body – but apps like Goh\'s can help guide travelers in the right direction.\n\nIn Indonesia, authority for halal designation lies with the Indonesian Ulema Council, and there are analogous bodies in other Muslim countries. But in Muslim-minority countries it is ad hoc: In Japan alone, there are about 10 different halal certification bodies, says Ayang Utriza, an Islamic law expert at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium.\n\nBack in Lombok, some tour operators have made a brisk business of arranging excursions for visiting ulema, or Muslim scholars.\n\n"When ulema come to Indonesia as visiting preachers or for religious holidays, they frequently stop in Lombok," says Farchan, the halal tour operator. "I or one of the other halal tour guides will help arrange private visits for them to one of the halal gilis," the small islands that dot the Lombok coastline.\n\nFarchan is a Salafi Muslim, meaning that he follows the Sunni fundamentalist school originating in the Gulf that seeks to return to the early Islam of Quranic times. He says he has helped vacationing Salafi preachers, both from Java and the Middle East, to relax in religiously acceptable surroundings in Lombok. They can decamp to single-sex beaches, for instance, after lecturing in Mataram, the mainland capital.\n\nAll this seems to raise a question of an inevitable culture clash between sybaritic beach bums and devout visitors. But so far, the spirit of halal tourism, at least in Indonesia, seems to be one of live and let live.\n\nOne place that\'s not likely to ride the wave of halal tourism? The United States.\n\n"People are concerned with safety and Islamophobia in the U.S., especially," said Goh. "Based on what we\'ve observed of our audience, traveling to the U.S. is less desirable than other destinations that are closer to home or are known to be more tolerant towards Muslims." But, he adds, this has not stopped Muslims\' desire to travel in general.\n\nKrithika Varagur (@krithikaltheory) is a freelance journalist based in Indonesia.'),

accelerate the development of the Lake Toba area are extending the Sibisa airport`s runway in Tobasa District, constructing hotels and accommodations in the Lake Toba area, building a toll road from the Kualanamu Airport to Prapat, dredging and deepening the lake in the Tano Ponggol area, allocating 500 hectares of land for "ecotourism," and intensively promoting Lake Toba, among others.\n\n(o001/INE/o001)\n\n\n\nJakarta (ANTARA News) - Indonesia has been intensively promoting the development of halal tourism in numerous provinces to attract more tourists from Muslim countries.Currently, the Ministry of Tourism has highlighted the importance of developing the Lake Toba area in the province of North Sumatra as another halal tourism destination in Indonesia.Halal tourism is considered important to be developed in the Lake Toba area since it has the potential to attract foreign tourists, especially from the Middle East or Malaysia.Tourism Minister Arief Yahya has stated that the aspect of halal tourism has been given serious thought in connection with the tourism attractions around lake since most foreign tourists visiting Lake Toba are generally Muslims from Malaysia.Hence, the Samosir district government has reiterated the importance of promoting halal tourism in Lake Toba and has taken the necessary steps to this end.Samosir District Head Rapidin Simbolon pointed out that several locations in the district already sell halal food items to Muslim tourists.Samosir is an island, almost the size of Singapore, in the center of Lake Toba, one of the natural wonders of the world.This enormous crater lake is actually more like an ocean and the largest in Southeast Asia and one of the deepest lakes in the world.The government is currently making all-out efforts to accelerate the development of road infrastructure, including a railway line from the city of Medan to Lake Toba, where visitors can sit back, unwind, and absorb some beautiful pristine scenery.As visitors sit and enjoy the view of the picturesque mountains set against the cool clear lake, they will feel their worries of the world melt away.Since Lake Toba sits some 900 meters above sea level, the climate is cooler, thereby making it a refreshing break from the heat, humidity, and pollution of the cities.Hence, Transportation Minister Budi Karya Sumadi has highlighted the government`s commitment to develop the railway line to meet the transportation needs due to the spike in the growth of tourists who will visit Lake Toba, in particular, and North Sumatra, in general.The transportation minister believes that North Sumatra is a viable area for development, and the government is keen to improve the transportation infrastructure, especially to Lake Toba.To build the railway line to Lake Toba from Medan City, the government is currently conducting a feasibility study, and the project is expected to be realized soon.Furthermore, the transportation minister expressed hope that once the railway line from Medan to Toba is completed, the people and tourists can use the mode of transportation apart from buses or cars.Toba has become a major tourist destination in North Sumatra and should also be easily accessible by tourists, according to the minister.If the construction of this railway line is completed, tourists are believed to more likely visit Toba by train, as they can get plenty of opportunities to enjoy the scenic beauty along their journey.With the availability of adequate infrastructure, it is expected that more domestic and foreign tourists would visit Lake Toba.Lake Toba is one of the 10 main tourist destinations in Indonesia along with the Borobudur temple, Mandalika, Labuhan Bajo, and Thousand Islands, apart from Wakatobi, Tanjung Lesung, Morotai, and Tanjung Kelayang.President Joko Widodo has instructed the relevant ministers to boost tourism, connectivity, and accessibility by developing infrastructure, such as airports, roads, and ports.The president has also emphasized the need to prepare a branding strategy that can be used for marketing, offering services of international standards, and showcasing art and cultural attractions through good choreography and attractive designs.According to the president, all tourism services and facilities in the lake area must be upgraded to meet international standards.The head of the state also called for improving the tourism attractions that visitors throng in the lake area."Art and cultural attractions should be on display in a well-choreographed manner and should be attractively designed," he remarked.The president has also instructed to improve connectivity with Lake Toba and its surrounding areas to make them more accessible.To this end, seaport and airport infrastructure in North Sumatra must also be developed further.Tourism Affairs Minister Arief Yahya has expressed optimism that Lake Toba in the Indonesian province of North Sumatra would become a top tourist destination in the world, attracting scores of domestic and foreign tourists.According to the tourism minister, the development of Lake Toba must not remain stagnant and must continue as planned.One of the key reasons for the success in developing tourism at Lake Toba is the fact that the management is being undertaken jointly by the heads of seven surrounding districts: Samosir, Toba Samosir, Simalungun, Tapanuli Utara, Karo, Dairi, and Humbang Hasundutan.Lake Toba has been designated by the government as a tourist destination of international standard in an effort to improve the living conditions of the local population.In an effort to develop the area into an international-standard tourist destination, the Lake Toba Tourism Authority Board (BPODT) requires a budget of Rp21 trillion.BPODT Finance Director Faisal remarked that such a huge budget to support the development of Lake Toba to attract one million tourists in 2019 must be backed not only by the central government but also the local government and private parties.Funds worth Rp21 trillion from the government and private parties will be needed to develop the Lake Toba area into a world-class tourism destination, with a target to attract one million tourists in 2019, Faisal reiterated.The BPODT finance director explained that the number of tourist arrivals in North Sumatra and Lake Toba, in particular, had decreased by 270 thousand in 2014 due to accessibility constraints to Lake Toba, which can only be reached from the Kualanamu airport."It can take four to five hours to reach Parapat from the Kualanamu airport. Hence, the government must take serious steps to develop the Lake Toba area by prioritizing transportation infrastructure," he noted.Developing Silangit Airport into an international airport to attract Singaporean tourists as well as various other infrastructure, such as the Tebing Tinggi-Pematang Siantar-Parapat highway, and revitalizing the four-point crossing to Samosir is expected to help realize the target of one million tourist arrivals in 2019.Faisal admitted that the target to attract a million tourists was no easy task if one were to solely rely on the budget from the central government. He expressed hope that the provincial government of North Sumatra and the regional governments would prioritize tourism as a sector that contributes to the local revenue.The central government has outlined numerous steps to accelerate the development of Lake Toba as a strategic tourism area into the Monaco of Asia.EDITED BY INE(T.O001/A/KR-BSR/O001)'),

Its activity decreased in late October and many returned to their homes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, on Saturday the mountain sent smoke up into the air for the second time in a week in what volcanologists call a phreatic eruption — caused by the heating and expansion of groundwater.\n\nSo-called cold lava flows have also appeared — similar to mud flows and often a prelude to the blazing orange lava of popular imagination.\n\nIndonesia, the world’s most active volcanic region, lies on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” where tectonic plates collide, causing frequent volcanic and seismic activities. /cbb\n\nRead Next'),
